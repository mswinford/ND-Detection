comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect 
of genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because 
genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term 
effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not 
want to consume them. I would like to see all genetically engineered 
foods labeled as such so that I can choose not to consume them in any 
form.

Thank you for your help.
