Dear UDSA,

As a medical doctor and a scientist I am appalled by the cavalier way we are releasing genetically engineered organisms into our food supply and environment.

There is no long-term research to support taking this approach. Currently most of the processed foods you can buy in the ordinary supermarket has a chance of being in some way genetically engineered. The average American has no idea that this is so. We are being led down a path of no return by the biotech industry whose powerful lobby seems to control our government.

It has taken mother nature at least millions of years to evolve the delicate balance in our environment. We depend on this for or survival. Why should corporations and research institutions be allowed to play Dr. Frankenstein with our health, our food supply, and our environment?.

We shall reap what we sow. If we sow genetically engineered organisms into our fields, we shall reap consequences which we shall surely regret. We must keep the organic food label 100% free from genetically engineered organisms. 

How many times have we gone down a path in the name of science, only to find negative consequences? How many times do our corporations develop chemicals, or drugs that have negative side effects and we don't find out until much later? In the case of genetically engineered substances, once they are put into the environment, they cannot be recalled off the shelf like a drug.

Please don't listen to the powerful money-driven lobbies of the biotech industry. Much more research is needed. The health and well being of future generations depends upon it. Please don't allow the organic label to contain genetically engineered foods.


Sincerely,


Michael R. Busch M.D,. PH.D
