I was just listening to KQED in San 
Francisco,

My background:

I am a consumer of organic products

I have a BA in Physics

My Concerns reguarding Organic products:

I would like to see a two tier labeling for organic products as suggested by one of the radio program's callers.

As I understand it, the organic guidelines are less restrictive than I would like. On the other hand, they are far superior to standard (non organic) regulations.

I would like to see two organic standards: eg. "Organic A" and "Organic B"

-One would be just as you are currently proposing--general enough to encompass irradiation and enough to create a target that many larger agriculture companies can aspire to reach.

-The other would be strict: no irradiation, no chemicals added, no genetically altered products, etc...

The first is a compromise that helps raise the bar on product quality of larger commercial growers.

The second is to satisfy the needs of consumers of organic products.. These consumers (me) are probably well educated on this subject and already go through the trouble of spending more and looking further for good food. Passing a substandard regulation would undermine my efforts to find good food.

Lastly, if you are forced to go with one label and set of standards, go with the stricter label. The products I buy will probably suffer from a watered down standard.
