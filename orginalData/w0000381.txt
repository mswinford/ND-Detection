comment = I am writing in regard to the proposed rules for organic products. I am most concerned about the thought that any foods that may be genectically engineered or irradiated would be considered organic. I am a vegetarian. I have raised two healthy children as vegetarian. When they ate any meats, we obtained organically raised meats. My children drank only raw, unpasteurized milk as children with no harmful effects. Thee was no risk of contamination from BGH or high doese of antibiotics or other contaminants in their milk. Now it is impossible to obatain, to the detrement of all. My children drank naturally prepared juices with no pasteurization, without harm. Now the health benefits of enzymes are denied to us all in commercially prepared organic juices. We must move away from the control of agriculture by Con-Agra (Monfort Meats), ADM, Monsanto, Ortho, and other mega businesses for the health of our citizens. 
Did you know that you can safely decontaminate meats by soaking them in a solution of grape seed extract and distilled water, 10 drops per gallon, or the same dilution ration with bleach or 35% hydrogenperoxide? This seems much less harmful and less costly to the health of Americans than trying to dump nuclear waste in the same fashion fluoride and chlorine is used to contaminate water. We should be using the advanced water purification systems such as used in Europe and installed in communities like Belle Glade, FL.
It is time to wake up and look into the harmful effects of genetically engineered food and irradiated food. This should be other than a reactionist approach that is so common from bureauratic agencies. No billions to industry on this issue, support and protection to citizens first.
Thank you.
