comment = Under the definition of "synthetic" the term "naturally occurring biological processes" is used, but is not defined. The definition of terms should be amended to insure that biological treatment systems, such as aerobic and anaerobic digestion are included as acceptable (not defined as "synthetic").

The term "synthetic" should be broad enough to include biosolids that are produced from sewage sludge, raw animal manure and/or other organic materials.
