comment = To whom it may concern can we trust you to look out for us the little people or are you going to be bussiness as usal . With people who would put poison on playgrounds,you know pressure treated wood . I just hope when we get stuff in the stores from other lands that we will be safe to eat, since we eat these things because they are suppose to be good for us not hurt us....
