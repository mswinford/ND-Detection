Since the proposed Organic Standards proposal excludes any language
regulating genetically engineered organisms (geo) and since the law
currently says it is illegal to label genetically engineered organisms
sold, as long as there are no regulations, genetically engineered organisms
grown under "organic conditions" can be labelled as organic foods and no
one can tell whether their foods are geos or not. 

It is necessary that all geo's be specifically excluded from any category
of organic foods (they should also not be considered synthetic organic
foods).
