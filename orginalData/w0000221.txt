comment = To whom it may concern:
Please do not allow genetically engineered varieties to be allowed to be included in the type of seed acceptable for the US organic production standards. They present a serious threat to the balance of nature; i.e. the Bt New Leaf potato that contains bt may enable the potato beetle to develop a resistance to bt, thereby robbing organic potato growers of one of the only means to control this pest. In the worst case scenario that you do allow genetically engineered seed, they should be clearly labelled on the packages and any advertising or promotions and any products containing them should also be clearly labelled,i.e. "contains genetically engineered soybeans" so that consumers can easily make informed choices not to purchase them. Genetic engineering, as it has been developed so far, i.e. Roundup Ready soybeans, encourages MORE, not less herbicide use. Soybeans that are resistant to Roundup helps sell this dangerous product. I have been an organic grower for 10 years and do not know of a harmless herbicide. There are many effective mechanical ways to control weeds. Herbicides should not be necessary to organic farmers and should not be permitted because they threaten the health of soil and laborers. We also do not yet know the consequences of the effects of genetically engineered varieties crossing with wild ones. Good organic farmers who take your other recommendations seriously do not need genetically engineered seed; there are plenty of good varieties still available for different regions. I hope that biotech firms don't succeed in patenting all crop research and the USDA gets more funding so you can continue your important crop development work using more traditional means.
