Docket #TMD - 94 - 00 - 2

I am writing to request that your organization explicitly prohibit any produce being labeled "organic" that has been subjected to the following five agricultural practices:
1)	Foods that have been "genetically engineered."
2)	Foods that have been "factory farmed" using inhumane, intensive confinement factory style production methods on farm animals.
3)	Foods that have been raised or grown on land covered in the toxic sewage and industrial waste products called "biosolids."
4)	Any meat products in which the farm animals have been "cannibalized" by feeding diseased and waste animal body parts, organs, and blood back to the animals.
5)	Any foods which have been exposed to "nuclear irradiation."

In addition I oppose the new "national organic standards" bill which will make it illegal for producers and retailers to uphold and promote standards stricter than the USDA allows. The bill as it is currently written is a violation of free speech and of consumers' right to choose.
