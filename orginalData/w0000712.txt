comment = The following complaints, leveled by David Blair in the news group
misc.activism.progressive, would seem to completely counter the idea
of organic livestock:

"
* It [the national organic program proposed rule] violates the requirement of feeding only organically produced feed to
livestock raised for "organically produced" meat, dairy and egg production. 

* It violates the requirement of feeding dairy animals organically produced
feed for 12 months prior to producing milk and dairy products labeled as
organic. 

* It violates the organic standards of providing organically raised
livestock adequate space for movement and access to the outdoors. 
"

These restrictions are central to concerns of health of the consumer,
humanitarinism of the consumer (through responsibility for suffering
of their produce) and indeed affect the quality and flavor of the
product. Ignoring the intent of the original act would make the
labeling of livestock as "organic" a complete sham, and require the
creation of a new label for appropriately kept animals.
