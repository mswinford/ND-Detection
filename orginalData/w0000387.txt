I own a natural food store which sells produce that is only organically grown. I am empathetically interested in not legalizing the use of genetically engineered seeds for organic produce. I know my customers would not purchase the produce grown from such seed. DO NOT allow this to happen. Organic produce should NOT be grown from genetically altered seeds. 
I am also not interested in consuming anything genetically altered and neither are any of my customers. Please label all such foods.
