comment = All genetically engineered products should be clearly marked as such and should be excluded from the label "organic." 

The truth is, we don't know what effect genetically engineered products will have in the long-term, both for our health and for the safety of our food supply.

The only real benefits of these so-called products are to the vested financial interests of a few multi-national companies who want to control the supply and distribution throughout the world. 

They offer bad science, these same people who told us Thalidimide was safe, that DDT was safe, and on and on.

If they are going to produce these types of "foods" -- and make no mistake, manipulating genetics is NOT the same as creating hybrids, then such foods must be clearly labeled for what they are -- and they are NOT by any means organic.

The market will reject their Frankenstein products; that's what they are afraid of; that's why they are afraid of labeling. That's why they are afraid of truth in advertising.

And that's why it would be a travesty if their products would be allowed to be labeled organic. It's a joke. And I hope you can see through their millions of dollars of PR and "scientific" assurances. The fact it, once we go down that road, there's no turning back. Genetic manipulation, like a little knowledge, is a dangerous thing.

Please reject this notion of genetically engineered foods are "organic." For the sake of our futures.

Thank you.
