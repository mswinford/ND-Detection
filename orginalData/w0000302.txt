comment = Please, no not allow the use, in Organic Production, of any kind of genetically engineered seeds, materials, foods and related ge-products.
These unnaturally altered materials, product of human intervention, should not be released on the agricultural fields and natural ecosystems, nor for human use and consumption, without having been long-term, thorougly tested for bio-safety, and their effects on human health and ecological impact, have been appraised beyond any doubt.
