comment = I was a pure vegetarian for many years, and recently began including organically certified animal products in my diet. If the standards are lowered, allowing practices I consider cruel, such as overcrowding of animals, indoor confinement, etc., I will be forced to return to a pure vegetarian diet. I strenuously object to the lowering of standards in this area.

The proposal to not allow states to set their own, stricter standards, is particularly objectionable. This infringes on my right as a consumer to know what I am eating.
