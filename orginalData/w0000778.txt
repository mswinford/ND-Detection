comment = Hi,


 I think its great that the federal government is getting on the organic foods bandwagon. If this results in improving the health of the American population by improving their diet, I say great!

 What concerns me about the proposed rule is that it appears to be deciding what is organic and what is not, and then forcing other parties (the states) to go along with its decision. I feel that this is fundamentally wrong.

 I understand that the federal government has to make decisions on what constitutes organic farming, but it also needs to understand that its decisions will never be perfect for everybody. To this end, I would like to see that the law allows peaceful coexistence with other laws, without forcing them to register with, and be approved by, the federal government.

 Lastly, I strongly disagree with the provision of the law that allows foods to be grown with non-natural means and still be labeled organic. Specifically, I am refering to genetic manipulations, toxic sludge, irradiation, and factory farming. Maybe you could develop a new catagory, such as "Almost Organic", or "Used to be organic until we zapped it with nuclear waste". Anyway, I think you get the point.

 Please, I ask you to give consumers the ability to make intelligent choices. Please don't hold back information on what we are eating. 

 Thank You,
 Blake Drolson
