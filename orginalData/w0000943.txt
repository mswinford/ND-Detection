Ms. Eileen S. Strommes,
	I am a certified Master Gardener in Ventura County, California. 
My comments are from the perspective of a home (backyard) gardener who wishes to comply with organic practices.
	My comments are directed not so much to what the regulations stipulate but rather to what is omitted. To wit:
	Your preamble (97FR65849) states that the enabling legislation (OFPA) specifically excludes 'synthetic fertilizers' from use by 'organic' farmers. Your regulations (7CFR205.2), however, do not define 'synthetic fertilizers'.
	Your preamble states that 'synthetic fertilizers' are prohibited in section 205.7(d)(1). This section does not use the term 'synthetic fertilizer' and is so obtuse as to make me wonder whether urea is prohibited or not. The basic problem, as I see it, is that most unsophisticated gardeners have no idea how fertilizer is produced. Urea, as I deduce, is probably prohibited as it is a product of 'chemical' (Western Fertilizer Handbook, pgs 116-117) processes. Nitrate of Soda should be allowed as it is mined and mechanically processed (Op cit, pgs 115-116).
	I urge you to take two steps to remedy this confusion. First, re-title section 205.23 (which currently adds no value to the regulations) to 'Active synthetic substances prohibited for use in organic crop production'. List those products of concern to you: anhydrous ammonia (?), aqua ammonia (?), ammonium nitrate (?), ammonium sulfate (?), calcium nitrate (?), urea (?), etc. I can understand your reluctance to be specific as technology has a habit of inventing new substances. Let me argue, however, that you will have to update section 205.22 anyway (for the same reason) so it should not prove untenable.
	And second, please consider publishing a pamphlet and distributing it through county farm bureaus (University of California Cooperative Extensions in California) detailing what exempt producers (backyard horticulturists) must do to voluntarily be in compliance with these rules.
	Thank you, in advance, for your consideration.
					Sincerely,
					David A. Owen
