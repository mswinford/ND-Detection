comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of
genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human
health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as
so that I can choose not to consume them in any form.
