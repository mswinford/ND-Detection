comment = I am concerned about the break in consistency from the standards of organic labeling I have become accustomed to; i.e. - I have confidence that the organic food I purchase from growers now is not irradiated or genetically engineered, but the proposed rule would not ensure this.

It would be an eggregious act to permit such gross violations against the foods which Hashem (G-d) has made for humanity and the height of hubris for the NOP to decree that foods which are genetically altered, and which have been poisoned by irradiation (the only good nuke is no nuke) are now organic. It will be a lie funded by tax dollars.

I respectfully insist that the proposed rule exclude and prohibit irradiated foods and genetically engineered foods from organic status.
