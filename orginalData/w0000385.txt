comment = Following SHOULD NOT be allowed for "organic" foods:

Genetic engineering 
Irradiation
Sewage sludge as fertilizer

Labeling should be specific and if any of the above are allowed it should 
be noted on the labels. I would want to know about any pesticides or 
commercial fertilizer used in growing food as well as the things I have
noted above.

I was hoping this site would include the USDA proposal for organic food so 
I could comment more directly on the items under consideration.
