comment = I am very concerned about the proposed new organic food standards allowing irradiation of foods, animal cannibalism, genetically engineered foods and using human waste sludge in fertilizer.

If the USDA is not going to let the private businessman determine what's appropriate, we are all in even more trouble and I mean all. Me, you, our childres and their children.

Business is driven by money. You must be driven by the right thing to do.

Please do the right thing.

Sincerely,

David Harrison
