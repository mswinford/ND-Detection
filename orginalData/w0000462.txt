comment = I should be appalled that the USDA has ignored the requests and comments of the organic farming community through its certifying organizations and representatives on the board regarding genetically engineered seeds and substances. It is not bad enough that our lifelong effort to produce safe food and fiber, despite hardship and ridicule from the greater agribusiness conglomerates, has been trivialized and bastardized by allowing SEWAGE sludge as "fertilizer" and irradiation of our pure products. No,now we are suddenly supposed to beleive that the same group which assured us that pesticides were safe 40 years ago are in the know regarding genetic engineering? This is inexcusable, and the USDA owes all of the real organic farmers an enormous apology, and an immediate correction of the rules regarding these issues. I have put my heart, soul, mind, and life into organic farming; I do not wish to see the USDA ridicule my efforts by bringing the very definition of organic into such an obvious compromise.
