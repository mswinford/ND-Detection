When it comes to the regulation of GE Foods, especially organic foods, representatives from ALL respective sectors should be consulted. Not only those representing the agri- and biotech businesses. Let's not forget that we are talking about that which allows us to be ALIVE - food - it's not only a commodity. Let us the consumers be part of the debate. It concerns the health and well-being of generations to come.
