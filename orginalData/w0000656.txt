comment = In regards to the proposed "New Organic Stanards". It is my deepest conviction that what you do with respect to "Labeling" of the Proposed standards be clean/clear and concise. And that no Genetic Engineering, Factory Farming, Toxic Sludge, Animal Cannibalism or Food Irradiation be included in the discription of the labeling. The word Organic should mean just that! 

I hope you take the liberty to follow the Standards set forth by the State of California in their 1990 rules!

Thanks for your considerations

Sincerely Organic!!
