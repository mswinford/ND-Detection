comment = I believe the term "organic" means or at least stongly suggests natural. 
Irridiation, I believe, is not a natural event and, therefore, defeats the intent of the label " Organic Food". Most consumers purchase organic foods because they believe that these foods are grown naturally without any non-
organic ingredients added in the growing process.
