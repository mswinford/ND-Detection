comment = As a concerned consumer I demand that the government must maintain strict organic
standards by explicitly prohibiting the unacceptable agricultural practices listed in this Alert. I am especially concerned about the use of active synthetic substances, non-agricultural (non-organic) substances and non-organically produced ingredients in organic farming and handling operations.

I also demand that private and state organic certification bodies be allowed to maintain stricter organic standards than those the USDA requires. This is a basic issue of free speech and of consumers' right to choose.

Thank you. -- Karil Daniels
