comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of
genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human
health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
Genetic engineering also provides serious potential hazards to those of us
with food allergies and sensitivities. I would like to see all genetically
engineered foods labelled as su ch so that I can choose not to consume
them in any form.
