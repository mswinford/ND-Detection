comment = I strongly feel that foods labeled as "organic" should never include any foods that have been genetically engineered. Such foods pose a great threat to the world food chain, since they are not proven safe, and likely to be harmful.

I also object to genetically foods on a religious basis, since I do not believe in eating foods that contain meat, or the DNA of animals (and the resultant chemicals generated by such artificial manipulation of nature.

There should be at least one way remaining that consumers can choose foods that do not violate their religious or intellectual beliefs.

Do no allow such foods to be included in the guidelines for "organic", not even on a case-by-case basis.

Thank you.
