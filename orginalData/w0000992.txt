comment = Just when you think it is safe to buy 'Organic' you're about to dilute the term. When I see Organic, I assume that it contains nothing other than natural ingredients grown and prepared in a ecologically safe manner.

Organic is supposed to mean as close to natural as possible. I second the other comments in that this does not mean irradiated food, nor genetically engineered.

Also the 95-100% content you are proposing isn't right. It either is 100% organic, or it isn't organic. An you propose that value by weight! I'm thinking in terms of parts per million, like the EPA does...

It appears that the definitions were made up by Corporations trying to cash in on the move for a healthy lifestyle... I don't want the term Organic to end up as another marketing term like 'new and improved'.

Please look to California's standards and certification methods, and look at Rodale's guides to Organic Gardening.
