comment = I sincerely hope, that any chemically altered plant will not be considered organic, now or in the future! I do not what to have to choose between an 
altered seed source or none at all. I ask that you will allow all those people who are working so hard to keep all the strains from being obliberated not to work in vain. I garden organically, I do not use any synthectic components in my gardening. I stick to untreated seeds and I hope, only unaltered seeds, as well. My clentelle would be very upset if they learned that their foods were comeing from altered plants.
I also hope that each state will be allowed to apply stricter rules if they feel that the National ones are not high enough. 
All in all I think the rules are a good idea. I Just hope that you will not be letting Monosoto Chemical Co tell you how it should be done. They are not organic by any means.
