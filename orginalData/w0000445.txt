comment = I AM OPPOSED TO IRRADIATED FOODS,TO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD AND TO FOOD GROWN ON SEWAGE SLUDGE LAND. I BELIEVE THESE PROCESSES DESTROY THE NATURAL GOODNESS OF OUR FOOD BY FURTHER DEPLETING IT OF NUTRIENTS. i BELIEVE GROWING FOOD ON SEWAGE SLUDGE LAND INTRODUCES BACTERIA INTO THE FOOD THAT MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS.
