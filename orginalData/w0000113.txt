comment = How exciting! Finally the long awaited regulations. Federal support for organic farmers is a critical aspect for the future of our country. We have become riduculously carried away with unecessary pesticides and the health of our general population is already seeing the detrimental side effects of these estrogen mimics. I'd vote for taking the organic regulations to the extreme and exclude irradiation and genetically engineered foods. I for one don't want to consume them. Another important part of these regulations is certifying organic farmers for free. It makes no sense to allow those farmers who poison the general population to do so without a fine yet force organic farmers, those striving for sustainability, to pay to provide healthy food. I'm overjoyed at this landmark and excited to see the act in effect. good job!
sincerely,
Suzanne Gray
