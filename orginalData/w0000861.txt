Consumers of organic foods go to the extra expense and inconvenience for a variety of reasons. They may wish to insure that the product they consume contains its full amount of nutrious substances and has not been vitiated in any way. They may wish to limit as much as possible the intake of chemical substances about whose effects we know very little. They may wish to "walk lightly on the earth" causing as little damage to the environment as posssible in the process of meeting their nutritive needs. Many, like myself, buy and use organic products for all of the above reasons. The use of irradiation which, for example, lengthens the shelf-life and also most likely reduces the nutrient value of products should not be allowed on products called organic. The same is true for genetically engineered plants and the use of sterilzed sludge. All of these technologies have a place in our society but not in the production of organic food. The organic label should mean one thing only: that the food was produced and treated in way that our grandparents would recognize as whole, fresh food, free of high tech treatments.
