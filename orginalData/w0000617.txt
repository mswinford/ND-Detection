comment = We understand that Biosolids are being excluded from beneficial use in organic crop production. We strongly encourage the NOSB to rethink their definition of Biosolids as a synthetic substance. Biosolids are in fact a nutrient rich organic material, subjected to a variety of technology and performance standards.Dr. Rufus Chaney and others at USDA have been involved in testing soils and crops produced utilizing Biosolids for over twenty years. We have an ongoing involvement with a large number of organic growers who use Biosolids in their programs with excellent results.
