comment = I feel that by allowing genetically engineered foods to be organic is an oxymoron. How can something be from this Earth if we humans must first muddle with it and create something that Mother Nature never intended? Being a very strict Vegan and eating only organic foods I find it very disturbing that this is even under consideration. My only question is how much are they offering to buy your organization for if you are even considering such an obviously moronic proposal? I hope you will do right by those of us who see the wisdom in not consuming chemicals and see that we are not a burden on the health care world because of our choices. I choose true organic foods for a reason and I'm more than willing to pay the price. But don't you even think about trying to sneak sub-natural foods into my local healthfood store. Like all people who eat like I do, I'm VERY informed and I won't buy the garbage that you are proposing be labled organic in the name of making money!!!!
