comment = I am writing to you concerning the proposed U.S. government definition on organic foods. 

I think that this definition should not include any type of genetically engineered food, any type of food grow on a toxic waste site, any type of factory farmed food, or any type of food irradiation, or animal canibalism.

I hope that you seriously take these considerations. 

Sincerely,

David Bullock
