comment = Currently Wild salmon producers, primarily in Alaska are not included in the prposals for the organic certification regulations. This oversight needs to be corrected. Alaskan,Washington,California and other wild salmon producers and processors should have the same right to market,lable, and certify their organic wild salmon. With this protection at the federal level we can retain our share of the market that chooses wild salmon over farmed. Without this protection retailer can continue to sell farm salmon as wild with no fear of enforcement or fines.
