I wish to express in the strongest terms my objection to the introduction and marketing of genetically engineered food products without their having been tested over long perions for long-term effects on health of consumers and on the environment at large.

I am particularly concerned about the attempt to capitalize on the concern of consumers who want to eat "organic" products by deliberately and callously using the "organic" appellation to include these genetically engineered freaks of nature.

Thank you for you attention to these importantr matters.
