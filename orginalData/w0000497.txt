Calling genetically engineered food products organic is a gross misuse of the english language. Do not include genetically engineered food items for human and/or animal consumption in any of the proposed Organic Standards. A moratorium should be called on development of all genetically engineered products untill a panel of expert scientists have completed a long term study on the environment impact and long term human and animal health impact of genetically engineered products
