I am opposed to the current changes being considered regarding organic standards. The term "organic" has developed a cultural meaning that excludes all synthetic, artificial, genetically altered or irradiated foods. Any proposed changes to that "cultural" definition would be inappropriate and unacceptable to growers and consumers of organic foods.
