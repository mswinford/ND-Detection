If the proposals are not strengthened or "tightened" I envision a new "super-orgranic" or "pure-organic" label taking shape (just as the "organic" label did -- at the consumers demand) and becoming popular -- sending the USDA back to the legislative drawing table once again. Please make this a "one time effort" and aim for, thus providing the consumer with, a stronger, more pure definition of organic.
