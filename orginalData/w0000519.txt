comment = I feel it is everyone's right to know what they are eating. Genetically Engineered Foods should be labelled as such and they should be tested ON HUMANS for LONG-TERM side-effects. Any drug has to undergo rigorous testing via the USDA, so should any crop, animal or food whose DNA has been altered to produce desired effects. Further, GE food should never allowed to be classified as organic simply because its very nature has been manipulated. Please listen to the concerns of millions of people around the world, and care a bit about how this new technology could impact the health of this planet and its inhabitants. Please allow us the consumers to make a choice.
