I do not want the standards to be watered down. I think the national standards should be as strict as California's standards. Please ensure that no biotech, hormones, or irradiation is included in the regulations. Also, I think independent certifiers should be allowed to continue. And if the U.S. organic certification allows these things that we don't want in our food, then growers that don't have them (for example BGH) should be allowed to advertize that fact on product packaging!
