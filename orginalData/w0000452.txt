I object to the proposed rules because they fail to prohibit the use of genetic engineering, intensive animal confinement, food irradiation, toxic sludge, or animal cannibalism in so-called "organic" agriculture. In fact, these are the agricultural practices that are causing consumers to switch to organic foods in the first place.

I also object to the proposed rules because they will basically make it illegal for organic producers and retailers to uphold and promote organic standards which are stricter than the minimal standards required by the USDA under these rules.

This goes against everything that organic farmers have been working for over the last 30 years. 

I urge the USDA to preserve the integrity and the rigor of the standards which are currently in place throughout the country, and not to undermine them in deference to the lobbying power of the agribusiness industry, who would profit from such watered-down standards. Consumer protection will suffer if the proposed rules are adopted, and the term "organic" will be rendered meaningless.

Thank you for this opportunity to comment.
