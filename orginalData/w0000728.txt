comment = The idea of allowing genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect 
of genetic engineering in organic production is quite alarming to me. It is clear that genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment. Therefore, I do not want to consume them; and furthermore, I believe it is my right to know whether or not I am about to consume them. Organically produced foods are the only resource I feel comfortable with these days. In my mind, it is a small demand to require that all genetically engineered foods are labeled as such (at the very least in the "certified organic" arena) so that I may choose not to consume genetically engineered products in any form.
