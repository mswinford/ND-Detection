comment = Gentlepeople,

I have read with interest the background and purpose of this set of regulations. Although I am not involved in any aspect of the organic food industry, the significance of the proposed regulatory structure should be apparent to all.

I do have friends who purchase organic foods and consider them (sometimes based on medical advice) important to their health. It is important, therefore, that the American public be assured that the products they purchase meet reasonable organic food standards. I trust the regulations here proposed will assure that such is the case.

I also am acquainted with a person who is engaged in organic food production. Her farm is a member of one of the private certifying organizations which evidently have higher standards than those proposed here. I believe the Department should consider comments of present producers of high quality organic foods very seriously. It would be unwise to set standards so low that the limited market is flooded with products which have little claim to the organic label.

International considerations -- with the EU and others -- should be an important factor in the standards which you set. They should allow for domestic producers to export their products successfully to other countries on a non-discriminatory basis while assuring consumers here that imported products meet sound organic standards.

Several libertarian friends have suggested that this regulatory proposal is unnecessary and an undue infringement on the freedom of both producers and consumers. I am sure you will agree that this is a preposterous point of view and that you will proceed to issue such regulations as may be necessary in the broader public interest.

Sincerely,

Robert Prestemon
