comment = The Organic Farming Community does not want nor accept genetically altered or created products. The consumer wants to know if thier food has been created in a lab or is a product of farming technique. Please do not allow genetics to play a part! I have been a part of genetic research for some time, and I feel that the product is safe and worth using, but I do NOT want to impose on others beliefs. The people who wish to consume foods without technology deserve that right. The organic label implies a "natural selection" and nothing more. Do not approve a label that misleads the people into thinking that thier food is not "altered". From my experience, many "natural" foods that we do not grow commanly in this country can do wonders in production, disease resistance, and pest resistability.
Furthermore, no irradiated product should be listed as organic. Irradiated food is not a natural occurance.
People should be able to choose. Choice is the American Way! If the people eating orgaic foods should become sick without irraditation (through say E-coli) then we shall reconsider. Otherwise, do NOT, irradiate food.
