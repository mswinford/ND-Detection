comment = In just briefly going through the proposed regulations, I am afraid you are
being way too lenient on the definition of "organic". You are making the rules too easy, and for all of us who are "pure organic" this is a big disappointment. The regulations are too lax--animals need to be feed 100% organic feed for at least a year. The purpose of being organic is to make farming easy on the environment, to make humans' presence here on Earth as least detremental as possible. The new regulations allow for just about anybody to become an "organic" producer without really working towards it and cleaning up their land and practices. It is unfair representation to consumers. Farmers can be conventional 9 months out of the year, and organic 3 months out of the year. This does not make sense and should not be labeled "organic." I do think that this proposal is a step in the right direction and will get more farmers to consider using less pesticides and chemicals and feed additives, medication, etc. Just call it something other than "organic", like 25% natural. We farmers who are "going organic" aren't doing it only for increased profits. We are doing it to preserve the earth and all its inhabitants, yet make a decent living for our families and communities. The higher prices compensate for the extra labor and often-times reduced yield. Don't let coorporations get into this, too, like they have with poultry, hogs, etc! Save family farms!
