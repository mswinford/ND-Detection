comment = As a consumer who has tried to keep up with the news, it seems to me
that there has been plenty of evidence over the years of the safety
of food irradiation, so I believe this process should not preclude an
organic label. However, biotechnology is quite new and concerns about
its safety seem more reasonable. On that basis, without more
specific evidence, I would oppose permitting the use of genetically
engineered products to use the "organic" label.

Thank you for offering this period of public comment.
