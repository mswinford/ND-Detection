comment = I am a consumer of "organic" produce. Ideally, I'd like to purchase 100% of
my food from "organic" sources. I am also a vegetarian mainly due to the
inhumane treatment of animals in the meat and poultry industries. I would
like to see the following substances prohibited for use; hormones,
antibiotics, chemical insecticides and animal byproducts for feed. And I
am against any food irradiation.The instances of excessive and polluting
practices by many large producers shows me that smaller is definately
better, when the production can be accomplished in the most natural and
humane way.
