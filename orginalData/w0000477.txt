comment = I would like to have the choice of whether or not I put potentially harmful food products into my body. That is why I prefer to buy food labeled organic. The long term effects of genetically engineered food is unknown at this time. I feel very strongly that genetically engineered food be in any form, including the use of genetically engineered seeds, be labeled as such so that I can make a choice with regards to consumption of these kinds of products.
