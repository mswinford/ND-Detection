comment = while I applaud those who brought this program into being and those who are trying to establish rules for it's operation, i have major disagreements with the convoluted and unnecessarily complicated rules that are resulting 
AND with the lack of integrity behind some of them. 

This is about truth in labeling and truth in general. PERIOD. The package SHOULD contain healthful ingredients that promote the common good, it SHOULD say what it contains and the amounts thereof, the information SHOULD NOT be misleading and any information not contained on the package about its contents SHOULD be easily accessable to anyone who wants to know. There is NO justification for withholding this information from those who buy and consume the product. If it won't help business, that busineses shouldn't be helped...

The same logic should be applied to the use of genetically altered foods. If you determine they are healthful, that's a good first step. But doesn't excuse you from identifying them as such on the label. The people want to know and they must be respected and informed!
