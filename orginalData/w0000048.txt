To eastablish guidelines for Organic Food Labeling without restricting biotechnology, irradiated foods, or the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, is ludicrous. The inclusion of any of these methods in the production of food labeled organic is untenable. 

Also, the percentage composition of foods labeled organic should be 99% not 95%.
