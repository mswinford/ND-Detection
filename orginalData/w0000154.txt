comment = Under NO circumstance do I want to have genetically engineered livestock
or any irradiated products considered acceptable for the "organic" foods 
labeling.

I also think that livestock feed should be regulated to prevent the livestock
from being fed "recycled" animal by-prodcuts. 

Livestock that is considered organic should be treated with the barest minimum 
of hormones & antibiotics. Personally, I'd rather have them receive no 
hormones of any kind.

Living conditions for livestock should also be addressed in any proposal that 
is made to deem foods "organic".
