comment = As a long time supporter of CSA programs, organic products and small family farms, I am delighted that the Dept of Agriculture is moving toward establishing a uniform standard for organic products. I am very much in favor of the assurance such a standard would give to the consumer. However, I am deeply troubled by the lack of proposed regulations regarding the exclusion of genetically altered plants and animals, irradiated food stuffs and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer. Unless such things are excluded, the standards will make a mockery of the word, "organic". Unless adequate safeguards are provided to the family and community supported farms which pioneered the organic movement, a national standard will only serve to destroy the very organic providers it should be supporting. Corporate agribusiness does not need assistance; family farms do.

I would like to hear from the Department of Agriculture regarding its plans and proposals with regard to its position onf genetically altered plants and animals, irradiated foodstuffs, the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer and the proposed standards. My address is: 5514 Doyle Street, #7, Emeryville, CA 94608. I look forward to your reply with interest.
