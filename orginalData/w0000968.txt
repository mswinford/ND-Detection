comment = How can you allow crops fertilized with toxic waste [from sewage systems] to be considered organic? Organic farmers, like myself, have developed an adequate definition of organic. Now you are revising the whole concept, presumably to clear the way for large corporate growers [who would be more inclined to use biotechnology] to take over the niche that we have created.

Shame on you.
