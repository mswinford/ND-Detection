comment = My health is at stake, in the proposed USDA organic food rules. As included in "organic" foods:
They allow genetically-engineered foods, whose long-term effects are unknown, to be sold without suitably-defining labels.
They allow crops raised on possibly-toxic farmlands to be sold without suitably-defining labels.

This is lousy protection of the nations's food supply!
