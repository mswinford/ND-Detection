comment = The proposed rule is deficient on at least six (6) points. It does not:

1) specifically prohibit use of genetically-engineered organisms;

2) specifically prohibit factory farming;

3) strictly prohibit animal cannibalism;

4) specifically prohibit food irradiation;

5) specifically prohibit sludge fertiliser;

6) provide for stricter standards by state or private bodies.

As such, the rule is grossly inadequate and needs substantial revision.


Please acknowledge receipt of these comments and provide explanations 
on these points.

Thank you,

Patrik Schumann
