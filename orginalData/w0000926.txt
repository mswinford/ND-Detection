comment = The proposed rules appear to take into account the need of local government agencies to control mosquitoes and other vectors, and I am pleased to see the organic farmer will not be impacted by a government performed application (ie loss of certification for three years) but I am concerned about a liability issue...if the grower cannot sell his crop as organic for that year, who makes up the difference? Is there a difference 
between the sale of organic and nonorganic crops? If local government's are required to pick up the difference, rather than pay it, we will be forced to utilize the California Health and Safety Code and intitiate fines of up to $500 a day until the mosquito problem is resolved. This is obviously a poor solution. To help clarify this situation, would the existing regulation of "not exceeding 5% of the established tolerance from a government pesticide application" apply here? (I may not have it spelled out exactly right, but I hope you understand the comment)
