I am opposed to the use of genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering in the production of organic foods. 

Genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health or their long-term effects on the ecology. As an educator and a researcher, I am appalled that we would make decisions allowing these foods to be available to the public without much more extensive testing.

As a consumer, I have made the conscious decision not to consume genetically engineered foods. I would still like the option of purchasing organic foods that are produced in the United States. If genetically engineered seeds and techniques are permitted for the production of organic foods, I would no longer purchase any produce that is grown in the US.

I would also like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so that I can continue to purchase foods produced in the US (organic or otherwise) that have not been genetically engineered.
