comment = The successful growth of the organic food movement has been necessitated by the deliberate government policy of encouraging the use of unnatural chemicals and growth hormones that manage to imitate natural growth processes but short circuit the naturally occurring growth process. Consumers know the difference and have accordingly expressed themselves in the marketplace.Now the USDA must show a distrusting consumer movement that it has learned it's lesson and will try to honor the consumers' request to avoid unwanted high technology inputs in the form of food irradiation,genetically engineered seeds, hormones and reuse of sewage sludge in the building of our soil. The very essence of organic farming is the utilization of wholesome mineral rich soil which has been made rich very slowly through appropriate crop rotations and plantings in prior years. The mindset that would even consider reused sewage sludge as a constituent of organic farming would absolutely discredit the program before it got off the ground, which unfortunately may be the goal of some people in the USDA who have been overly influenced by the agribusiness sector of the economy.
