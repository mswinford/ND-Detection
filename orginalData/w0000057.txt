comment = The United States citizenry have made many mistakes in my lifetime in regards to our health and nutrition. One of the greatest is bowing to the misinformed paranoia concerning the irradiation of food for preservation purposes.

Please include in the public information concerning the new act/law, a concise, simple (8th grade reading level with lots of graphics)explanation of the facts about irradiation and its lack of possibly harmful side effects on persons consuming food preserved by the process. I realize this has been done before but it is imperative to keep on trying!

As our world nears the end of the millenium, with so many improvements in our standard of living as a result of research and applied technology, surely we can, through our government agencies, clarify facts and use discoveries that will be so beneficial.
