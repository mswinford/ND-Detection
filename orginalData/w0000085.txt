comment = state programs should have NOTHING to do with national programs, regarding 
certified organic. provided that everything is clearly labeled whether it 
is nationally certified, or state certified. these labels SHOULD co-exist 
on shelves next to each other.
only this can ensure that new ideas are given a 'testing ground' before 
being argued into or out-of the national standards. without this 'testing ground' approach, the national standards are doomed to remain stagnent,
and become obsolete.
also, there will always be debate as to something furthering, or hindering the national standards. this would allow these decisions to be made where 
they will be the most efective, regionally.
