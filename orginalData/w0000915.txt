comment = As a consumer, when I buy organic produce (or meat, but I don't, as I don't eat meat), it only has meaning to me if that indicates that there are no non-organic substances used in the production of the food. That means, no synthetic materials. If synthetic materials are allowed, I will no longer pay any attention to the label organic at all. I am sure that this is common among those interested in clean foods, so in effect by allowing this provision the organic industry would be harmed rather than helped by a definition which muddies rather than clarifies.

A quote from Under the Tuscan Sun expresses best my feeling about food:

She is writing about a produce store in Cortona, Italy,

"Many of her customers are tourists, stopping in for some grapes or a few peaches. A may buys fruit and makes motions of washing his hands. He points to the fruit. She figures out that he's asking her where he can wash it. She explains that it is washed, no one has touched it, but of course, he can't understand, so she leads him by the elbow down the street and points to the public water fountain. She finds this amusing. 'Where is he from that he thinks the fruit isn't clean?"'

The point being that in Italy, for instance, the preponderance of produce is grown organically. That is the norm. The deviation is for it to have had chemicals used in it's production. If we are to work towards a similar norm, then the standards we set must be immaculate, or we are simply paying lip service and what we will have instead is another public relations scam, another meaningless label with which to market goods.
