comment = I'M ON A SIX MONTH STAY IN AUSTRALIA CURRENTLY, BUT AM VERY CONCERNED WITH ALL THIS, SO WANTED TO WRITE BEFORE I RETURN TO THE US. I APPLAUD THE ORGANIC PROPOSED RULE AS FAR AS IT GOES, BUT YOU'VE LEFT OUT SOME IMMENSELY IMPORTANT TOPICS.

1. PRODUCTS LABELLED ORGANIC MUST *NOT* BE ALLOWED TO HAVE BEEN IRRADIATED. 
PRODUCTS LABELLED ORGANIC MUST *NOT* BE ALLOWED TO HAVE BEEN FERTILISED WITH SEWAGE - I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE RIDICULOUS. THERE ARE SENSIBLE WAYS OF USING UNADULTERATED HUMAN SEWAGE ORGANICALLY, BUT THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM, AND ANYWAY I PRESUME WE ARE NOT TALKING ABOUT UNADULTERATED HUMAN SEWAGE BUT THE SUM TOTAL OF ALL THAT GOES DOWN OUR DRAINS - IE TOXIC WASTE.

2. ANIMALS SHOULD NOT BE TREATED WITH ANTIBIOTICS - FARMERS WHO ARE SERIOUSLY USING ORGANIC METHODS CAN TELL YOU THERE ARE MANY MANY OTHER HEALTHY SAFE SUCCESSFUL OPTIONS. PEOPLE WHO DON'T MIND INGESTING ANTIBIOTICS CAN BUY NON-ORGANIC FOOD. THOSE OF US WHO BUY IT DO NOT WISH TO.

3. THE TOPIC THAT CONCERNS ME MOST OF ALL IS THAT YOU HAVE INCLUDED NO BAN ON GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD BEING LABELLED ORGANIC. TO START WITH, THIS WOULD GO AGAINST THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF ORGANIC AGRICULTURE. BUT I PERSONALLY AM, DUE TO MY OWN RESEARCH WHICH I HAVE UNDERTAKEN AS A RESPONSIBLE PARENT, TERRIBLY WORRIED ABOUT THE INTRODUCTION OF SOMETHING NOT PROVEN SAFE, AND IN FACT LOOKING VERY UNSAFE ACCORDING TO SCIENTISTS, INTO EVEN THE MAINSTREAM FOOD CHAIN. I THINK IT SHOULD BE BANNED COMPLETELY UNTIL PROVEN SAFE. WHY SHOULD WE HAVE THIS STUFF TRIED OUT ON US?

MOVING GENES BETWEEN ANIMALS AND PLANTS COULD RESULT IN THE CROSSOVER OF DISEASES (A UK REPORT RECENTLY LIKENED THE RISKS OF GENETIC MANIPULATION OF FOOD TO THE PRACTICES THAT RESULTED IN CJD (MAD COW DISEASE).
IT COULD RESULT IN UNEXPECTED MUTATIONS AS GENES RESPOND TO THEIR NEW ENVIRONMENTS IN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS.
IT COULD RESULT IN SEVERE ALLERGIC REACTIONS (THERE WERE SEVERAL DEATHS IN ONE PARTICULAR USA PRODUCT RELEASE)
WHAT IS WORSE IS, IT IS AN IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS, AND GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO CROSS POLLINATE UP TO 2KM, SO THEY MAY START TO CROSS-POLLINATE WITH OUR NATURAL CROPS. THIS WILL LEAD TO A LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY THAT MAY LOSE US MANY OF OUR CROPS AND LEAVE OTHERS VULNERABLE TO DISEASE.

APPARENTLY MANY COUNTRIES WHERE THESE RISKS ARE BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY ARE LOOKING FOR MARKETS TO PROVIDE THEM WITH GUARANTEED GENETICS-FREE FOOD CROPS TO PROVIDE FOR A GROWING CONSUMER DEMAND. IT WOULD MAKE A LOT OF SENSE ECONOMICALLY FOR US TO CATER TO THIS GROWING MARKET AND ENSURE OUR ORGANIC FOOD IS GENETICS FREE. 

PLEASE, YOU MUST ADD RULINGS ON THESE THREE POINTS.

THANK YOU
