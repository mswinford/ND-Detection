comment = I am not married to the word “organic,” however I want an ultra-conservative label for food that says, “this product is as close to the way nature grew it as we can get it without going back to being hunter-gatherers.” For me, that means no hormones, no pesticides, no antibiotics, no extra radiation. It means that the chickens and livestock are vegetarian, fed with food I personally would want to eat and/or handle. Certainly it would NOT mean that any animals involved would have been fed other animals.
