comment = In the whole document, a product is considered organic if 95 percent
of ingredients are organic. No requirements are imposed on the other
5 percent. It may consist of substances that the consumers who choose
organic products want to avoid.

This is highly unfair to the consumers and to a great extent makes
the Proposed Rule useless.

If a product is only 95% organic, it has to be labelled "95% organic",
and the size of the font used to write "95%" has to be the same as
the size of the font used to write "organic", so that the consumer
can see it clearly without reading the whole fine print all over the
package. All non-organic ingredients have to be clearly listed (general
description like "artificial flavor" is insufficient).
