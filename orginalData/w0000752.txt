comment = If "organic" is to keep its true meaning, no sludges, no fake (genetically-altered) foods, no synthetic substances in growing, or anything else that heretofore has been considered less than "organic" should be permitted. Otherwise, organic food will be just one more area that's been taken over and prostituted by the moneymen for their own pockets, with no thought for our well-being. It's getting too late for their continued ravaging and poisoning of Earth. Please spend our money as we want it spent: to keep pure foods pure.
Most Americans will not respond here - it's too complicated and they don't think they know enough to speak intelligently on the topic. But believe me, and I do know, that people absolutely loathe poisons in their food, air, and water. We want to believe in our government agencies, we want you to do the right thing - you are us, at least that's how it's supposed to be. Since we do not have a direct vote on what should be done--although we should since we are the ones affected--we have to depend on you.

Because everyone's health depends on you, I hope you're up to doing the right thing.
