comment = Dear "Secretary Dan Glickman" and Staff of the USDA,

This is in response to USDA request for feedback from consumer, agricultural and business groups over the next 90 days, regarding the "Rules for U.S. organic food production." as well as "Labeling." In a "reuters" news feed article I noticed a few uunresolved points such as the use of biotechnology, irradiation and the use of human waste as fertilizer. 
I am vehemently opposed to the use of (genetically-modified crops) in any food product period. Particularly with regard to those labeled "organic." I find it extremly disturbing that such a proposal would even be considered.
Further I am opposed to organic food irradiating, and human waste use.

I do not appreciate my elected officials usurping my right to choose. I want to see labeling for all foods that have been (genetically-modified) via man-made biotechnology, and for foods such as milk that contain BGH etc. I may or may not be opposed to having common foods irradiated etc. What I do not appreciate is having the opportunity to choose whether or not to consume them taken away, which is exactly what happens when there is no labeling that identifies these modifications.

Please stop catering to the industry and act in the best interest of your employers! How did foods escape such labeling? $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$?
