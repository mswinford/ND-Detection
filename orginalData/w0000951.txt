comment = -Genetic engineering techniques should only be allowed in organic agriculture (or any agriculture) only if they involve genetic manipulations that theoretically could be accomplished using conventional breeding techniques. Inserting genes from one organism into another unrelated organism is not acceptable. Inserting BT bacteria genes into plants, or animal genes into plants, or any similar type of manipulation is potentially dangerous to our ecosystems and human health. These types of practices are certainly not acceptable under organic certification if at all.
