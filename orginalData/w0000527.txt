comment = The Proposed Rule and the USDA involvement is burdensome and excessive. By adding another layer of bureacracy and more fees to the organic producer we are condemning more small farm organic producers to extinction.
The 5,000 dollar exemption should be raised ten fold to 50,000.
The entire program should be funded through an alternative source rather than on the backs of the small organic producer. I suggest that a levy be placed on agrichemical manufacturers who are dessimating our planet with their patented biocides. That levy should fund all the NOP. The entire earth benefits from organic production not only the small organic producer. This benefit should not be borne by those who are creating a better world for everyone , but rather by those agrichemical manufacturers who incrementally and insidiously broadcast their poisons into our soil, air, and water.
