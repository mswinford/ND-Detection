comment = Please prohibit the use of sludge as fertilizer and other biotech chemicals for killing bacteria. The primary distinction of "organic" from non-organic is that chemicals are not used in the production.

Though sludge ought to be used in farming, it seems inappropriate to allow its use with organic produce, since it may contain chemicals in addition to natural components, unless you can come up with a way to regulate sludge to ensure that it contains only waste products of natural origin.

The use of biotech chemicals is contrary to the notion of organic, even if it is used to kill bacteria. Just because a product is organic does not mean you should not take proper precautions in prepartion. The use of chemicals to kill bacteria would also lull people into a false sense of security. People who buy organic produce are trying to behave responsibly and that includes using proper handling and preparation in order to prevent exposure to harmful bacteria.
