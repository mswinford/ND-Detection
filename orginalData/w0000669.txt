comment = I support the new national organic standards but I do not wish to have genetically engineered substances included in these new standards because of the possible environmental and health side effects. In addition, I do not support irradiation due to the reduction in nutritional value and the possible carcinogens introduced into the foods. Also I do not support the use of sewage sludge as part of the new national standards due to the possible content of this sludge, including radioactive materials and other toxic chemicals (radioactive material has been found in sewage sludge in Colorado). Lastly, I support natural, sustainable, environmentally friendly agriculture practices such as those currently utilized by organic farmers.
