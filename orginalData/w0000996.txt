comment = As a retailer, I have a fair amount of daily interaction with the general public. Being a retailer of "healty foods," including but not limited to organically grown products, the portion of the public with which I am acquainted is probably more biased towards the purity of the product which we would call "organic." However, being a single grocery store, I feel a great degree of responsibilty to my clientele, and it is on these grounds that I feel it necessary to comment on these proposed rules. I believe strongly that the use of irradiation as a means of controlling any pest or disease should be prohibited if the product is to be certified as "organically grown." I am certain that the majority of the customers at our store would feel the same.
