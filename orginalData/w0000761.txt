comment = The American consumer should be able to depend on the label "organic" meaning natural from start to finish. This would preclude genentic engineering, irradiation and the use of municipal or industrial sludge as fertilizers.
Please lets make the organic label 100% honest and dependable. Not the joke of percentages, assembly points and corporate preferences that constitute the label made in USA.
Thank you, Kathy Hodsdon
