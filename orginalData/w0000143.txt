comment = Foods labeled organic should NOT include anything irradiated or containing animals genes (genetic manipulation).

In the event that the government does allow foods that have been irradiated or genetically manipulated to be labeled organic, those foods must clearly state that the item has been irradiated/genetically engineered to allow consumers to make a choice. Strict vegetarians and those keeping the rules of kosher need to know if the produce they are buying contains animal/pig genes.
