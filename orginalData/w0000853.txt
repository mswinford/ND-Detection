As a consumer, percise labeling of organic foods is crucial to my decision to purchase. I want to know if a food product has been irradiated, if it has been pumped with hormones, or if it has been genetically altered. I would lose confidence in the organic food system if a food item that is only 50% organic is allowed to be label 'organic'.
