comment = When I buy a product labelled "organic" I expect that it will have ZERO genetically engineered content, that it will NOT have been irraditated,and that NO sewage products have been used in growing it. Issuing regulations different than these would be a disservice to consumers, and result in endless litigation. I don't want the protection I enjoy under California law reduced. I happily pay more for food that meets these requirements. I hope the USDA will begin to represent the taxpayers that fund the organization rather than the Agribusiness Corporate-welfare recipients that lobby it for special favors so successfully. The ENTIRE organic food industry is a reaction to the failure of these corporations to provide us with healthy food. I believe it to be the fastest-growing segment of the industry. Please don't ruin it for us consumers.
 Thank you,
 Michael Daley
