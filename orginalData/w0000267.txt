comment = PLEASE do not allow genetically modified plants, irradiated foods, sewer sludge and hormones to be allowed (on a "case by case" basis) by the Standards.

As the nation's second largest retailer of natural and organic foods, Wild Oats Markets, Inc., (my employer) provides millions of consumers with clean alternatives to foods containing artificial ingredients, preservatives, hormones, "irradiation," chemicals, and genetically modified organisms.

As a consumer, I trust the government to protect my right to buy foods I KNOW have been raised and produced WITHOUT the aforementioned ingredients. 

I also trust the government to require manufacturers to label products as such, especially new foods containing GENETICALLY MODIFIED ORGANISMS.

The proposed regulations do not protect my rights to be informed in these areas.

Thank you.
