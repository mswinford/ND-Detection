comment = I have severe reservations regarding the use of irradiation and genetic engineering on foods labeled organic.. I also question
the advisability of using sewage sludge on organic crop land. "Organic" should denote naturally raised, healthy foods. I am
totally opposed to genetically engineering and irradiation of "organic" foods!
