 I do not consider anything that is genetically engineered to be TRULY 
organic in the most holistic sense of that word.
 Because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their 
long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do
not want to consume them, or feed them to my children! 
 Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect 
of genetic engineering to be used in organic production.
