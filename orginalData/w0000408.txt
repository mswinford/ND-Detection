comment = Please do not allow the introduction of genetically engineered seeds or any other genetically engineered products into the organic food supply, because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment. I also do not want to consume irradiated foods for the same reason. Please do allow the use of toxic sludge in the production of organic food.
