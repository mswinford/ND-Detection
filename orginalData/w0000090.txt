comment = If the proposal is passed into law, I will not consider "organic" produce to be any different than conventionally-grown produce. I do not consider food that has been genetically altered, irradiated or fertilized with treated sewage to be organic.



California's standards are well defined and reasonable. They should be used as the model for the nation.
