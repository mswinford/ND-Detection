comment = Allowing genetic engineering, irradiatation, antibiotics, and the use of sewage sludge into the organic food supply will defeat the purpose of the NOSB having spent seven years of grappling with national standards in the first place. It will have the seasoned organic consumers searching for the few local brands they know they can trust (ones that don't use these technologies)—which, ironically, is exactly what many were doing before the standards. It will also have those who were just getting curious about organic foods deciding it's not worth spending extra money for something that's not so different from all the other food they can buy.

I urge you not to buckle to the demands of big industry profiteers who are looking to manipulate organic production to suit their bottom line. Contrary to statements made by by some at the USDA, this IS about health—the health of the planet. A growing number of people are now willing to pay more to support earth-friendly organic practices. It would be a shame to pull the rug under this movement with watered-down "standards."
