comment = The new organic food standards should *** NOT *** allow

 irradiation of foods
 
 genetically engineered foods
 
 municipal sludge (human waste often contaminated with dioxin and heavy metals) to be used as fertilizer
 
 factory farm techniques that confine livestock
 
 animal cannibalism (feeding back animal parts, offal and blood to farm animals), a process that led to Mad Cow Disease in Europe

None of the above practices are consistent with what consumers of organic food want in their food supply!

In addition, the new organic food standards should allow producers, retailers, and local authorities to uphold and promote standards stricter than those defined by the USDA. 

Last but not least, clear and detailed labeling of organic foods should be not only allowed, but encouraged (if not required).

Sincerely,
