comment = People buy organic because they believe it is PURE. Allowing the use of sludge as fertilizer, or irradition, or gene altering DRAMATICALLY changes people's perception of the product. Whether or not that is rational, it is very true. In fact, allowing denigrating substances and scientific alterations in producing food labeled organic would have a negative impact on the market for organic food, because people would lose their faith in whether purity was in fact guaranteed.

Organic agriculture has been proven to improve soil, reduce people's exposure to toxic substances, increase yields with some methods, and restore the balance of nature to habitats, species, and others who were almost irreparably harmed with poisons, soil depletion, and disruption of the food chain.

I urge you to consider a set of standards which will not allow exceptions to the rule in the side door, as businesses often do. The health and welfare of the existing organic industry, as well as the American public, depends on it. Thank you.
