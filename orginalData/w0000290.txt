comment = My wife and I are beginning market gardeners that have organically gardened for years. I have no problem with the recordkeeping that you want except that in the past, we have brought in trailer loads of manure, spoiled hay or straw, etc and applied it to the garden. We have no records of amounts or when applied. We added what we could get in the fall or spring as weather and time permitted. We also have used cover crops, but again did not record when and what.

How do we now prove to an inspector that we are indeed organic?

We had our soil analyzed by Utah State University last year, but nothing there will really show organic vs nonorganic except for the soil organic matter.

Is there a way to test the soil? Could the inspector randomly take samples for analysis to initially certify the "organic" state of the soil?

We are not yet to the point where profit exists ( expenses and capital are much greater that income ) but would like to get to where it is a recordable business ( profit exists ).

I do not have a problem with the $50 annual certification process but submitting a plan for under .5 acre of garden seems just a bit silly. $5000 worth can be grown in a very small area. Could there be a simpler process for small acreage part time market gardeners?
