To Whom it May Concern:

I am writing concerning TMD-94-00-2.

I understand that the proposed rule would allow certification for irradiated or genetically modified products or products grown in fields fertilized with sewage sludge. In addition, the proposed rule would allow certification for products from animals fed waste from slaughterhouses, or in certain cases from animals kept in confinement or treated with anitbiotics.. All these practices are now prohibited by all current certifying agencies.

As a citizen I expect that the USDA take seriously its responsibility to regulate on behalf of my health and nutrition and the condition of the environment. I also expect that the USDA respect the expertise and recommendations of the advisory board appointed to support the strength of the new rule. The proposed rule is far too lax in allowing the above practices to be permissable in food labeled "organic." I ask that you return to the recommendations of your advisory board and act on behalf of the citizens of our country who desire high standards for production of the food we eat.

Our health is our nation's best asset!

Sincerely,

Claire Kia
