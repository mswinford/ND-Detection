comment = To whom it may concern;
I would like to say that with respect to the Proposed Rules on the "Organic Standards". I do not want to see or hear of any allowed "Genetic Engineering,Factory Farming, the use of Toxic sludge of any proportions, animal cannibalism or Food irradiation" mentioned in the Proposed Standards, period!
Your overall intentions are worth of doing. Please "Keep the rules simple".



Sincerely,

Leo A Blair II

PS. Please don't allow the Big AgraBusinesses to persuade you well intended Rules!
