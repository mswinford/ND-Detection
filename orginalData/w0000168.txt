comment = I am writing to register my strong objection to the proposed approval of "sludge" for use in certified organic farm products. Far from being a benign mix of concentrated human waste, sludge contains all manner of poisons and heavy metals, dioxins and PCB's that find their way into --but not out of-- our sewage treatment plants. Fields fertilized with the stuff have created documented health hazzards for humans and cattle in Sparta, MO in the early 90's and sickened residents of communities adjacent to sludge-fed fields. The substances present in sludge are some of the same substances that consumers of organic produce strive to keep out of their food and the proposed approval of sludge-fed produce in the organic family is a major slap in the face for both consumers and farmers who are genuinely dedicated to creating a safe food supply. If the USDA allows sludge to be used in organic farming it will have a long and difficult fight to regain credibility among the growing number of American consumers of organic foods.
