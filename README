This is a program for Near Duplicates detection. It will cluster the files saved in folder "originalData" into serveral ND clusters. 
The clustering result is saved as "ND-Cluster.txt"

How to run:

Type the following commands from inside the "ND-Detection" directory:
make clean
make
./ND-Detector.sh

The third command may need to be run more than once if an error occurs. This is because our random sampling can result in a dataset with no exact duplicates, which means there is no seed docoment for our clustering algorithm. 

You can also change the number of files to randomly sample by altering the value of "SAMPLESIZE" in "ND-Detector.sh" script.

To clean up the files that are output by our program run "make clean" command.
