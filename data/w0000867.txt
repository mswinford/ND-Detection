If the product must be made with substances that are not 
organic, then it does not need to be labeled as organic. 
It's not as if the product cannot be sold. Just not sold as organic. 

"Although the NOSB recommended that substances extracted with a synthetic
volatile solvent (such as hexane) or that contain propylene glycol as a carrier be prohibited
for use in organic products, we believe our proposal to allow their use only when
alternative substances or products are not commercially available does not affect the
integrity of organically produced products.
