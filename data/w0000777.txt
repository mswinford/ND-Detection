comment = (my first portion of comments just disappeared - so forgive the resulting 
lack of continuity).
OF COURSE THINGS SHOULD BE LABELED, BUT IT SHOULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING AND 
NOT JUST BE THE BURDEN OF THE ORGANIC FOLKS.

OBVIOUSLY, EVEN IF LABELED, CERTAIN CATEGORIES CANNOT FLY UNDER AN ORGANIC 
BANNER. THIS INCLUDES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SEEDS AND PRODUCE, CROPS AND 
LIVESTOCK RAISED ON SLUDGE FERTILIZED LAND, IRRADIATED FOOD OR SEEDS.

tHE STANDARDS AS THEY ARE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. BETTER TO 
WAIT AND LET THE CONSUMER KNOW THINGS ARE NOT YET DEFINITE, THAN GIVE THE
ILLUSION THAT WE ARE PROTECTED - WHICH THE STANDARDS AS THEY ARE NOW WOULD DO.
