comment = I would like you to please consider the importance of your decsion. As a consumer of organic products. I want my products to be free of irradiation, chemical fertilizers, raw sewage, or untreated manure. I want the products to be grown in area where there is no chemical run off from another farm. I want my organic meats to be fed organic food, and no hormones,or antibiotics. It is very important organic food be in a seperate category. Big farm companys are very interested in the organic industry because a growing number of people are now buying organic food. There needs to be strict guidelines maintained for organic food. People who chose organic food also want to help the little farmer stay in business and stay healthy. I do not like what is happening to many grape pickers in Chile who are getting sick just from picking food off the vines. It is their pestisides that are making them ill. I believe the Calif. standard for organic foods is a good one. Please, no Irradiation,pestisides, hormones, chemical fertllizers, raw sewage or untreated manure. THese are not wanted on organic foods!!

Thankyou,
Susan Johnson
