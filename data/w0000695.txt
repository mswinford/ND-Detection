comment = Products from animals that are routinely dosed with drugs such as growth hormones or antibiotics (when they are not ill) should not be allowed to carry the label “organic.”

Products from animals raised under inhumane conditions, such as on “factory farms” where they are always kept confined in cages, are overcrowded, or are never allowed outdoors, should not be allowed to carry the label “organic.”
