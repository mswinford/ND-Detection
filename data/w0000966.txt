comment = As a consumer, purchaser, and retailer for organic foods I urge you NOTto allow genetically engineered foods or irridated foods certified organic status. In my experienced opinion, by allowing those producers access to organic certification would nullify the endevor totally. I thank you for your work and I can only state again the urgency of this matter.
