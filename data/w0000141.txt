Genetically engineered seeds should NOT be allowed to be used in ORGANIC agriculture or labeled as organic.

The issue is bigger than IF they are semantically "inorganic".

The issue that this is the LAST resort to be able to choose as a consumer whether or not to consume genetically engineered substances. 

If we can not know that ORGANIC foods are free of these absurd and potentially very dangerous substances then we have completely lost the right to choose what we eat. 

I realize that Monsanto and other big companies spend a lot of money on promoting their products and buying legislation. I only hope you have more integrity than they do.

Let the consumer decide if they want to eat that garbage. The only way we can exercise our right to decide is if it is labled. Since they have already BOUGHT the laws to keep from having to disclose the genetically engineered elements the only hope is to keep one class of foods absolutely free of them. That is what ORGANIC foods need to be or they are worthless as a guarantee of health promoting qualities.
