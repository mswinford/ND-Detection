comment = To Whom It May Concern:
I am writing in regard to the proposed organic standards legislation. While I think trying to provide certainty to the consumer is a positive
move, I have have several fears regarding this proposed legislation. In
summary, I am concerned about 1) irradiation of food--I would like the
legislation to state that irradiation is a prohibited practice for "organic" products; 2) biotechnology--I would like to see severe restrictions of such practices supported in the legislation; 3) use of "sludge"--I would like the use of sludge as a fertilizer to be prohibited if a food is to be considered organic; 4) humane living quarters for livestock animals--I would like the legislation to have requirements for keeping livestock that insure adequate and humane treatment (e.g. pasture grazing and free ranging...); 5) costs to small/local farmers--I would like whatever inspection/certification process mandated by this legislation to be at a REALISTIC low cost to small/local farmers (remembering that $50 is much different to a person in NYC or D.C. than to a person in rural Iowa...) I know my thoughts are shared by many who may not have the time/means to contact the USDA--please take these concerns into consideration during this open comment period. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Sara Vogel
