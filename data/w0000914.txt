comment = "Organic" is the use of naturally occuring cycles of growth and decay, birth and death to the benefit of the Earth, the crop, the animal, and the human. 

In regards to organic standards, I do not feel that irradiation or genetic engineering belong in organic production systems. When I purchase a product that claims that it is organic, I wish to be assured that it is not genetically engineered, irradiated, or from an animal that has been fed hormones or other substances.

A product that is labled "organic" should be organically produced. All products not organically produced should not be labled organic. Doesn't this make sense? Please do not let politics and money stand in the way of the truth! 

Any product that is genetically engineered, irradiated, or treated with unnaturally occuring treatment such as hormones should contain this information on its' label AND not be called organic because it is not organically produced. In addition, producers who claim that their product does not contain such substances as hormone-laced milk should be held free from legal persecution (SLAPP suit). 

In short, in order for the labeling of organic foods to be truly effective, the USDA must:
 1. Prohibit genetically engineered foods from being labled as organic.
 2. Prohibit irradiated foods from being labled as organic.
 3. Prohibit foods whoose history includes addition of hormones/other substances from being labled organic such as cows milk that comes from cows who have been fed hormones.
 4. Prohibit SLAPP lawsuits against companies who label their product as not containing these or other substances
 5. Require foods that have been irradiated, genetically engineered, or otherwise altered to contain that information on its packaging. 
 
Sincerely,
