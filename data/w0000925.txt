comment = I believe that the proposed organic food standards should:

1. Specifically prohibit the use of genetically enginneered organisms and/or require special labelling to alert consumers if they are purchasing genetically engineered produce, providing details as to the nature of the modifications.

2. Strictly prohibit the feeding of dead or diseased animals back to animals of the same or similar species.

3. Specifically prohibit food irradiation or provide labelling that warns consumers of it.

4. Specifically prohibit sewer sludge as a fertilizer.

5. Allow private and state certifying bodies to maintain stricter organic standards than the USDA provided they differentiate between USDA approval and their approval as organic.
