comment = It seems relatively obvious that food labeled "organic" should not 
include that which is irradiated, genetically engineered, grown with synthetic chemicals, or hormones in the case of animal products.

I will be very impressed if the USDA chooses to protect consumers' rights 
to know what they are buying over corporations desire to get away with whatever makes them the most money.

It's great to give us a place to comment, but the important part is actually acting positively on that input. I have not seen one comment along the lines of "please sell me irradiated/ genetically engineered food, not only without my knowledge, but under the name "organic"" Now please listen to us.
