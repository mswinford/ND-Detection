comment = I am particularly concerned about the following;

1. The USDA standards should NOT be less stringent than
those standards already in place in California.

2. The USDA standard for "Organic" should NOT include
any genetically engineered foods.

3. The USDA standard should NOT label any animal products
"Organic" if the animals have been kept in intensive confinement.

Thanks you for your time and consideration.
Respectfully,
