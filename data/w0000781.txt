comment = As a consumer, I feel very strongly that foods labelled "organic" should be grown without pesticides or the use of any fertilizer besides organic compost. This is the assumption that consumers have when they enter the grocery stores. To allow foods grown under any other methods to be labelled "organic" is a thinly veiled attempt to deceive consumers of organic food products. It is not difficult to conclude that financial interests representing fertilizer, chemical, and waste management companies are using their influence and lobbying ability to ruin the value of the "organic" food label. I was not aware that deceiving consumers, selling out to lobbying interests, and ruining environmental causes were among the goals of the FDA. It would seem that one cannot become cynical enough quickly enough these days.
