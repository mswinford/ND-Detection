comment = Geneticly Engineered food in every phase of the organic food chain should be prohibited. This would include GE seeds,GE-derived fertilizers or other agricultural inputs, and foods produced from GE sources or using GE processing agents or their derivatives ( e.g., rennets, enzymes such as alpha amylase, etc.).  Irradiation should be prohibitied under the organic label. It fosters continued reliance on nuclear thchonologies in general, and doesn't fit into the traditional organic orientation. It has been likened to GE in its reputed ability to modify chemical structures in the food it treats, particularly creating novel proteins, whose bioactivity is completely unknown and unpredicatable.  Use of municipal sewage sludge as orgnaic fertilizer should be banned under the rules for Organic Standards. Aside from the human waste issue, organic accreditation boards have decried sewage as contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead, which are readily absorbed by many crops.  All organic livestock, for meat or dairy consumtion, should receive feed which was grown and processed without the use of Genetic Engineering, irradiation, and municipal sewage sludge.   There seems to be two seperate issues to be delt with. The first is the definition of organic and the second is food safety. The definition should be determined by those who grow, eat, sell, and promot organic food not by outside industrial ambitions/greed. At a minimum organic has always ment natural from start to finish and any attemped to change that, like the Proposed Rules/Organic Standards, is nothing short of a crime. People know what Organic means, your Proposed Rules/Organic Standares just muddy the water. Keep the rules/standards simple, natural from start to finish.  The second issue is that of food safety. Food safety is not an organic issue it is an issue for the whole food industry.
