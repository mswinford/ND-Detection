comment = Prohibit genetic engineering in every phase of the organic food chain--not only GE seeds, but GE (or GE-derived) fertilizers or other agricultural inputs, and foods produced from GE sources or using GE processing agents or their derivatives (e.g., rennets, enzymes such as alpha amylase, etc.).
