comment = I DO NOT WANT produce marked "ORGANIC" to include the following things:  A: Irradiated foods B: Items grown with sewage sludge C: Geneticlly enginered foods D: Items injected with harmones or antibiotics  When I buy organic I am doing it so I will not have those kinds of things in/or done to my food. If industry wants to be included into the organic market they should come up to current standards, not that current standards should be lowered to include them. There is a reason why I buy organic produce in the first place, and I do not want my food zapped with radiation, genetically messed with, shot with antibiotics & hormones, or dumped with sewage sludge. Natural is natural, leave it that way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If I find out that following things are included into the ORGANIC labeling I will see to it that this is fought tooth and nail. I'm sick of big money trying to push it's way into every market that is doing well, and I see this as just another attempt of big industries to gobble up yet one more thing. Stop messing with our health, stop messing with our enviorenment, NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Did I make my point clearly, is there any question as to what I'm trying to say?  Thank you for your consisderation. M.K.
