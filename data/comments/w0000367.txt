comment = Crops treated with sewage sludge should not be accorded the "organic" label. The levels of heavy metals present in these sludges are too high.  I also oppose the use of the term "organic" to cover genetically engineered foods and irradiated foods. We do not yet know the consequences of using these technologies in food production, but on past experience it is likely that there will be unforseen negative consequences that will cause us to limit, focus or ban the use of these technologies.
