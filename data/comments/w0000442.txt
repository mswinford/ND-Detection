comment = I have been buying organically grown produce for twenty years, and take great care to consume only organically grown produce if it is available. When certification standards came in I was suspicious, but I recognize that there have been benefits to the consumers. But now, with the proposal to allow genetically engineered and irradiated food to come under the definition of organic, I feel that my choices will be much more difficult because of government intervention. I do not want to eat genetically engineered or irradiated food!  If you MUST allow this to happen, PLEASE set up a two-tier system, i.e. Organic Grade A, which means no genetically engineered or irradiated food, and Organic Grade B, which does allow the Frankenfoods.   Better yet, the government (state and federal) should get out of the certification business altogether. Private certifying agencies will rush to fill the void, and the consumers can choose which agencies to trust. And, no disrespect to the government, but I firmly believe that the private agencies will do a better job. At least we won't have to worry about one certifying agency forcing a major change upon us, because if we don't like that agency's definition, we can buy produce certified by someone else. Since most organic consumers don't want Frankenfood, I have no doubt those private agencies which rule them out will become the most popular ones.  Mark Hovila
