comment = The goal of providing standards for organic food products should be primarily to assure the consumer that s/he is getting a product that meets certain criteria. That is, the product was grown without man made chemicals, was not genetically altered by man, was not treated in anyway by man made procedures such as irradiation, was cruelty free no intensive/confinement practices with animals, and was produced in a manner that consumers could be assured were natural in the sense of not being bioengineered or chemically altered. Current regulations make a mockery of these criteria and appear to have been written by lobbyists for the pharmaceutical and chemical trade. If this is the case please do not pass any regulations. One must wonder if your goal is to gut the organic movement.
