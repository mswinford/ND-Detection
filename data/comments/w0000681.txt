comment = I'm very concerned to learn that the USDA has come up with regulations that effectively water down the current organic standards and further make it basicly illegal for the current organic industry members to uphold or promote stricter standards. Isn't this America? Since when does agribusiness, the beneficiary of this government action, need protection from competition of the small organic grower? Since when did an agency of our government think it had the right to errode the rights and freedoms of both organic groups and consumers in such a way?   As the mother and grandmother to several severely allergic children who've reacted violently to non-organicly produced products in the past, I find these new "standards" and the restrictions on private stricter standards absolutely unacceptable. I will lend my full attention and energy to turning over this ludicrous action.
