comment = Dear Sirs,  In reference to the Public Comments period for the National Organic Standards Rules, please accept these comments as a business person and concerned parent\citizen.  Bottom line, if the INTENT is to simplify the labeling of food as organic or non-organic, you will completely miss your objective.  Consumers will only become _more_ confused when some foods labeled Organic are un-adulterated, while other foods labeled Oreganic have been either genetically engineered or irradiated.  Probably most important, the genetic engineering and irradiation of food is anti-thetical to the very meaning and intent of the term organic when used with food.  Please take this in to consideration. James Robinson
