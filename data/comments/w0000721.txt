comment =  I approve the establishment of guidelines regarding organic food production and marketing. However, I fail to see why comparable labeling requirements are not being proposed for products including milk from cows treated with rGA/BHT or products treated with various types of radiation. If consumers are entitled to know, for example, that their food was grown truly pesticide-free, are they not entitled to know that thier food was not raised from genetically engineered sources? If we need to be warned about nuts in our food, shouldn't we also be informed about factors that might be more long-range in their effects?  Thank you.
