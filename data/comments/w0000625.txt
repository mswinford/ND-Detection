comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them. Genetic engineering also provides serious potential hazards to those of us with food allergies and sensitivities. I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as su ch so that I can choose not to consume them in any form.
