comment = The effects of genetically engineered foods have not been researched thoroughly nor for substantial duration to guarantee these foods safe for consumption. Therefor I do not wish to consume them. Please don't let genetically engineered seeds or any other mode of genetic engineering be allowed in organic production. As a matter of fact, I would like all genetically engineered food to be clearly labelled as such so that I and my fellow consumers could opt to not purchase them.
