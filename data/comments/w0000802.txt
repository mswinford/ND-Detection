comment = As a consumer I am extremely concerned about the proposed rules. The proposal of including food that is irradiated, genetically engineered or is treated with or fed any substance that is in fact not organic (such as municipal waste) under that category "Organic" would effectively render the word "organic" meaningless.   We need meaningful standards that are clear-cut and reasonable, not perversions of terminology that would destroy the consumers ability to choose food that has not been polluted with synthetic chemicals and unatural processes. The underlying pricipal I plead that you uphold is tha consumers need to know what it is they are buying. Food that is irradiated, genetically engineered, or treated/fed with syntetic substances should be explicitly labeled as such, and should not be falsely labeled as "organic". To do otherwise would crush consumer confidence in their food sources.  This seems to me to be an attempt by the extremely powerful and highly vested interests of agri biz to coopt a term ("organic") and a movement that is challenging their power. They seem to be afraid of the grassroots movement towards organic food and they see if they are able to undermine it dramatically by destroying the very words we have to describe the products we wish to buy. I hope the NOP will reject Agri biz's attempt to water down the word organic to a meaningless word. I hope you'll follow the excellent example that the state of California has set in creating a meaningful standard and will not interfere with California's right to determine its own food standards.  Thank you,  Marcus Johnson
