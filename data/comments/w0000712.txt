comment = The following complaints, leveled by David Blair in the news group misc.activism.progressive, would seem to completely counter the idea of organic livestock:  " * It [the national organic program proposed rule] violates the requirement of feeding only organically produced feed to livestock raised for "organically produced" meat, dairy and egg production.   * It violates the requirement of feeding dairy animals organically produced feed for 12 months prior to producing milk and dairy products labeled as organic.   * It violates the organic standards of providing organically raised livestock adequate space for movement and access to the outdoors.  "  These restrictions are central to concerns of health of the consumer, humanitarinism of the consumer (through responsibility for suffering of their produce) and indeed affect the quality and flavor of the product. Ignoring the intent of the original act would make the labeling of livestock as "organic" a complete sham, and require the creation of a new label for appropriately kept animals.   Joanna Bryson
