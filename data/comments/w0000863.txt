comment =  rules are to vague, allow for too many loopholes for the big agribusiness. why not spend more time looking at the state standards and make the federal standards more in line with them. too much feedback on radiation, sludge, and genetics, this is not what the true organic farmer uses or is interested in using. treated seeds are not organic, showing that the crop is not commercially available is not a reason to use treated seeds and to still be able to be organic. these rules are for the huge companies that want to claim they are organic and ruin what is truly organic for the small farmer of this country that are just trying to make a living.
