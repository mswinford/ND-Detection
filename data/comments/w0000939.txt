comment = I have been a consumer of organic products for over 15 years. I always felt confident that organic products are the purest and safest products I could provide for my family. While I agree that organic food standards should be set to clear up confusion that may exist with consumers, I am very angered and concerned to learn in an article that appeared in the New Jersey Herald about some of the proposed rules such as the use of sewer sludge as fertilizer and irradiation of produce. THIS IS NOT ORGANIC!  This is also not a way to support the organic farmer, who has had a real uphill climb from the beginning. When a consumer purchases an organic product it should be the result of conscientious farming that takes into consideration the consumer as well as earth friendly tecniques.  Please do not allow rules that imperil the principles of what organic really means just because some big agricultural company wants to get its foot in the organic door.  Thank you,  Christine Garcia
