comment = 1-7-98  My primary concern is with the problem our nation has with excessive dominaton of the political process by national/global corporate interests and thereby appointments of department heads of, for example, the USDA such that regulations promulgated thereby serve the interests of the corporations and not the interests of the U. S. Citizenry.   We are dealing with regulations that can impact on not only the economic viability of the environmental campatable organic food producers, but with the very health and well being of the Citizenry, both short and long term.  THEREFORE, I URGE ANY AND ALL STAFF MEMBERS OF THIS FDA EFFORT TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON ACTIONS THAT ARE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE U.S. CITIZENRY, ESPECIALLY IF THEY APPEAR TO BE DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF MAJOR ECONOMIC INTERESTS. REFUSE TO KNUCKLE UNDER! GO PUBLIC! RESIGN! WHATEVER IT TAKES TO ACT IN THE INTEREST OF THE GENERAL CITIZENRY!   Thank you and good luck!    Yours truly,    Clayton Stouffer Claton@pacbell.net
