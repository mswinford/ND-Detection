comment =  I have been an informed consumer of organically grown and raised foods and liquids for many years. Many studies link immune system disfunctions  and other illnesses to build ups of various chemical compounds in the body, none of which may be dangerous per se as a single compound. It is the cumulative effect of all of these toxins and chemicals in our air, water and food which much give any thinking person cause to be concerned. It is therefore imperative to avoid these items as much as possible in order to live a long and healthy life. To this end, we filter our drinking water, exercise and get enough rest and eat as much of our food from organic sources as possible.  The ONLY satisfactory requirement for the consumer is that we MUST know  that anything labeled "Organic" is in fact 100% organic. It it is not, it should be so labeled. Allowing irradiation of organic food, or allowing genetically altered food or food raised on sewer sludge to be labeled organic will force the concerned consumer to rely on other means of seeking out safe food. I for one will NEVER eat irradiated or  genetically altered or pesticide laced foods whenever I can do otherwise. The USDA should use the CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers) rules as a starting point and make it more difficult from there. The fact that big business wants to be "Part of the organic trend" is irrelevant.  Only 100% organic foods should be allowed the "Organic" label. Anything else can be labeled "Produced with 50% or whatever organic ingredients".  As a consumer, I am appalled that the USDA would even consider fudging the rules on something this important, and there are good rules already in place in the State of California. You would do well to use them.
