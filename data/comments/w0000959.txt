comment = I've been listening to the proposal reports from pro & con sources and I think you should just stop now and start all over again. It has become a "HEY, WHAT ABOUT ME" political "football game". Especially the "INERT INGREDIENTS" part of the proposal. TX & CA already have very good programs. I'm sure other states also have good one's. This is probably a good time for less government(although, saying this to a gov. agency falls on deaf ears, after all, your job (RIGHT or WRONG) is to control agriculture)Maybe you should have 2 programs Natural Organics USDA Organics
