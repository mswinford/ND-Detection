comment = Genetically engineered foods are not organic in any reasonable mind.   If those items are put into any foods labeled as ORGANIC they must show those foods that are genetically engineered. The consumer has the right to know.   I have the right to know as a mother. I refuse to feed my children any foods that have been altered in this way. It is against every ethical fiber in me. I must be able to know which foods are free of these items to be an educated consumer.   The USDA has the power to make sure mothers are able to finds foods for their children. If a mother feels she must have foods WITH GE items in them - she ALSO has the right to know and be able to choose.  Either way, the USDA is a servant of the people, not the other way around.
