comment = May I add my comments to the many that I have read who are against approving the use of irradiated foods, genetically altered foods and crops fertilized by urban waste. How can the USDA in all good conscience label food produced under these conditions as "organic"? If it weren't so serious, it would be laughable -- like Orwell's "doublespeak". Frankly I have to agree with one respondent. It sounds to me like the Department task force charged with coming up with these rules has been heavily lobbyed by industry. Now it is time you listened to the "man/woman in the street".  I will be watching with interest what you do as a result of these public comments.
