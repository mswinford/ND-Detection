comment = 	Simply, I want to KNOW if the food I buy was genetically-engineered. Even if you call it organic, I wish it to be labelled. 	Genetically-engineered food has not been fully monitored on its effects on humans. These unlabelled seeds/crops may infiltrate all corners of the seed supply, and where will we be if we later choose to rid ourselves of them?  	I want to ensure a safe future for my children and grandchildren. The only safe future I can envision includes reserving some parts of food production and food supply for the crops that were grown three hundred years ago before we thought we could improve upon them. 	Please take these words seriously. If I cannot trust that foods labelled organic are not genetically-engineered, I will grow my own and teach others to do so. Please don't force me to do that.
