comment =  Dear Sir or Madam:  I appreciate the ability to comment on the proposed regulations. As a consumer of organic produce, I want to express extreme concern about the possiblity of biologically engineered seeds being allowed under the new standards. These seeds are not natural, and should not be considered "organic". I'm also very concerned about the fact that irradiating foods kills the vital life forces within those foods, and do not want to see this practice allowed under the guidelines. Further, "sludge" being allowed as fertilizer is a very bad idea. There is a fundamental difference between properly composted animal manure and the output of sewage treatment facilities.  Mark E.
