comment = Genetically engineered crops are a very real threat to an ecosystem. The possibility of hybridization between an engineered and a wild-type species is high, which could release foreign genes into an ecosystem. This could have drastic effects on the stability of the ecosystem. There is no way to clean up gene pollution. If organic methods are generally though of to have low environmental impact, then genetically modified foods should not be allowed under an organic growing standard.
