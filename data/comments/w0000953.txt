comment =  I do not find the following acceptable as part of organic standards:  1) Irridated products 2) Genetically engineered products 3) Drugs of any kind 4) Raw manure or sludge  PLEASE do not relax organic standards to the point that the word becomes meaningless!!  I beg you!!!!  Sincerely,  Vonalda M. Utterback
