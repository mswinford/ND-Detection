comment = Because my husband has cancer and has been through radiation treatments, we have both found ourselves in our 60's reading for the first time many books on nutrition, the immune system, and alternative treatments to cancer. Each one names our government's "betrayal of health" (Joseph Beasley's researched book for the Kellogg Foundation) as a partner in the "cancer industry." This epidemic (one in three will get cancer) should be a public outrage!   Over and over again, the pesticides, the depletion of minerals in the soil because of chemical fertilizers, the transfer and production of our food, the lack of proper vitamins/minerals from "processed foods" only encourage our immune system to disfunction. A healthy immune system CAN kill cancer.  Organic food is something my husband and I have been eating now for well over three years and we think the California Organic labeling requirements are something that should be included in your federal labeling requirements.  It is very difficult to find a store close to us that thinks it is financially beneficial to them to stock organic food, and we must travel to Modesto (20 miles away) to a health food store to get our supplies.  I am certain that this is worthwhile. His cancer is not growing currently, and his exercise, diet, and innumerable herbs/vitamins/minerals has helped. PLEASE MAKE THE CALIFORNIA REQUIREMENTS A BASE FOR YOUR FEDERAL LAWS ON LABELING ORGANIC FOOD. PREVENTING CANCER IS EVEN BETTER THAN FIGHTING IT!
