comment = I had submited a general response to these proposed regulations a few days ago, so I won't go into detail right now. I was just informed about section 205.15 (b) "If necessary, livestock may be maintained under conditions that restrict the available space for movement or their access to the outside, Provided, That the other living conditions specified in paragraph (a) of this section are adequate to maintain their health without the use of animal drugs, except as provided in § 205.14(b)." This is very disturbing.  I'm not going to do into any detail about this, but many of us know what goes into producing an "food" animal and how they are legally abused. Who is to define what living conditions "are adequate to maintain their health"? The businesses who profit by abusing them? This issue is about ethics versus business profit. The organics regulation is *NOT* a place to argue this point. This whole clause should be taken out because of its irrelevance to organic production.  I, as well as a few people I have talked with, see this as a way for big business to slip in a clause into the exploding organics trend that will definately give them more profit.  Again, I do not wish to argue against animal abuses here. Sections 205.15 (b) does not have anything to do with organics and should be removed.
