comment = As a consumer of organic produce and a long time vegetarian and vegan, I am very much opposed to allowing irradiated food and genetically engineered foods to be labeled "organic".   Some of us want to make certain that we do NOT eat either of these categories of foods and if we cannot even be certain that we are not eating irradiated and genetically engineered foods, we may be forced to grow our own or buy only from farmers we know.  If people WANT to have food from these categories, I have no problem with them eating it, however, we who have made a concious choice to NOT eat these foods should be permitted this choice.  We need to have organic produce follow the truth in advertising and labeling laws. We can only make proper food choices with truth on the labels.
