comment = January 9, 1998  The proposed organic food act does not go far enough in defining "organic".   "Organic" should exclude genetically modified plants and irradiated foods. "Organic" should exclude factory farmed foods.  "Organic" should exclude animal cannibalism. "Organic" should exclude fields/farms that use sludge as fertilizer.  Private and state certifications should be able to maintain stricter standards than the federal organic act.   All genetically modified and irradiated foods must be labeled. The public has the right to know what they are buying and eating.  The USDA serves the American people. We have the right to eat clean, safe food. Downgrading current "organic" standards will hurt all of us.   Regards, Tamara Cartwright
