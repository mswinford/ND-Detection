comment = I am increasingly irritated over the encroachment of the federal government into the lives, business, and practices of private citizens. There is enough regulation already. There is no need to have any kind of federal government regulation of organic farming. IF there is a pressing need for a STANDARD, then formulate a standard and publish it. After that, anyone advertising a product as organic which does not meet the standard would be liable under existing laws to charges of false advertising and fraud. That is enough!
