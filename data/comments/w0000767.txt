comment = I would like to make several general comments:  1.	It is critical that Organic food be absolutely organic, according to organic standards as those in California.  2.	Any allowance for Sludge to be used as fertilizers in organic food production must have the same standards as other organic fertilizers.  3.	Radiated food should be totally UNACCEPTABLE in organic food preservation, due to the unknown long-term effects of radiation on humans.
