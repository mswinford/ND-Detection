comment = Dear People,  I am very concerned about this proposed rule. I would prefer that the federal government stay out of the natural foods industry altogether, since the industry arose largely out of disagreement with the federal government about what constitutes safe food in the first place.    I am particularly disturbed by the allowing of irradiated foods, genetically engineered foods, and livestock raised in overcrowded conditions. These are the very things I look to organic standards to protect me from, and to protect the Earth from.  I am also disturbed by the not allowing of states to set their own higher standards. If the national standards are going to be morally empty, it would be a relief to at least be able to trust the Oregon standards.
