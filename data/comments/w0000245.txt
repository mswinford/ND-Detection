comment = SAY NO TO GEO'S BEING LABELED ORGANIC!  I strongly feel that ALL genetically engineered organisms should be specifically excluded from any category of organic foods (they should also not be considered synthetic organic foods). If geo's are to be labeled as "organic", this will necessitate an entire underground labelling system for those of us committed to eating foods which have not been poisoned, making it even more difficult and expensive to find healthy alive food.  I have been eating organic foods for 25 years. It is one of the great mysteries of our society that this is considered "unusual". I am much healthier and younger looking than the average American. It is time that organic foods are the norm in our society!  PLEASE ACT ON THIS NOW!  SAY NO TO GEO'S BEING LABELED ORGANIC!  Very sincerely,  Dianna Rawleigh
