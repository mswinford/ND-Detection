comment = I strongly object to this proposed rule. By passing this you are taking what is "organic" and making it "non-organic" with additives and by-products. You will be subjecting the consumer to a variety of "hidden" items. I would think it would be obvious that by organic food implies that besides some natural fertilizers, soil and water nothing else be added to the food in order for it to be organic. Now if you intend to allow these procedures in organic food production I think you are in great error.  It is imperative for me to know whether my food has been irradiated, or genetically engineered. Any foods treated as such, should be LABELLED as such and separated from foods labelled as ORGANIC. Genetically engineered food is not "natural". It should in no way be included in the organic category.   Labelling foods that have been irradiated or genetically engineered as ORGANIC is MISLEADING to the public!
