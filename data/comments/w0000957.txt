comment = In regards to the proposed regulations on organic foods, I think that the views expressed by Pierce Watters and countless others (see "general" list of comments) are exactly right. Though I don't have anything against the growing of genetically engineered foods, I don't believe that those are even remotely "organic." The label "organic" is one which we as consumers have chosen to purchase foods which don't use human waste for fertilizer, which allow no pesticides (pesticides which ruin the natural ecobalance through destroying essential links in the food chain), which signifies foods free of irradiation. While these methods of food treatment and growth may be acceptable (though, in many cases, future results may dictate otherwise) they should remain the hallmarks of food grown by agri-business, not organic. I, too, believe that "organic" labeled food should remain 99% organic - chemical-free, irradiation-free, sewage (and, inherently, metal)-free, bioengineering-free. Having purchased organic foods for several years, I dread the thought of having that opportunity taken away from me in the interests of big businesses and profit-mongers eager to cash in on the increasingly popular "organic" label. Finally, I would like to add that this public forum is a marvelous idea, provided that the views and opinions recorded upon it are actually taken into thoughtful consideration and utilized in forming new, better, and more representative laws. Here can be a chance for democracy to truly work.
