comment = I've reviewed much of the USDA proposed rule regarding organically grown food. I am no biochemist, but I do think I know what the word "organic" implies when it's  referred to food and I don't think this rule is what I envisioned.  I see organically grown food as being grown without the aid of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, or chemicals. I also  see it as not grown on land fertilized with human waste.  As a citizen and voter I'm appalled at the verbiage used in the proposed rule. I will be satisfied when all referrals to "synthetic", "chemicals", "feed additives", and "drugs" are removed. I will also be satisfied when specific "non- synthetic" materials such as human waste are prohibited.
