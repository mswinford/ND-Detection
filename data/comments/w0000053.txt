comment = Please, Keep organic truly organic, no Human waste as fertilizers, Man may consume pesticides, traces would be present in waste.  Please, no irradiation, Organic does not mean exposed to gamma rays, it  means it was grown in the earth, picked, and sent to the consumer.  please don;t allow big business to nuke our organic food.  Please, do not allow genetic engineered crops to be called organic, Tomatoes with fish genes are not organic. Organic food is our last refuge for safe food, food as nature intended it to be.  please, keep up the good work !!!!!!!!!!!  regards,  John Calabria
