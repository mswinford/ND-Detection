comment = Genetically engineered food does NOT count as organic. We've done enough altering with the chemicals we've come up with for insects, clogged drains, house dust and personal hygiene, to introduce another snag in the rope of production is not a good idea. Simply put, since there is no way to effectively regulate genetic engineering of ANY sort, to state we can guarentee that's it's as safe as organically grown the old fashioned way, is haughty and ludicrous. I refuse to purchase genetically engineered food now, and I will not purchase in the future. To commonly link genetically engineered food with normally grown food, is deceptive to consumers like myself who don't want to consume the engineered stuff.  Leave the biogenetic edibles labeled the way they currently are. Don't disguise them as something else.  Kimberly Raymond
