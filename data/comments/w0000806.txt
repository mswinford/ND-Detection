comment = If the term organic is defined by your guidelines, it will certainly lose all of its integrity as far as I am concerned, which means that I as a consumer will no longer have any choice in buying food which is truly organic. Organic means treated completely conservatively, and affected as little as possible. It should absolutely NOT include foods that are genetically modified. I have the right to know if my food has been genetically modified and buy foods that have not been. Food irradiation is also completely unacceptable, as is the use of antibiotics in the production of dairy products. The use of sludge fertilizer is also NOT consistent with organic food production practices. These guidelines need to be changed to prohibit these practices.
