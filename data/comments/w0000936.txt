comment = Congratulations to everyone involved on your work in this important area. These standards will potentially touch every American.  I urge you to omit irradiated or genetically altered/engineered food from the organic label. Let's keep the term organic simple to understand: not corrupted or subjected to non-natural processes.  Also, I urge you to disallow sewage sludge as a fertilizer option unless that, too, is regulated.  Sincerely,  Diane Holmes
