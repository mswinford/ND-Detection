comment = it seems nonsensical to allow irradiated, genetically altered or sludge-fertilized foods to be labelled as organic.  "organic" in this specialized sense should be the closest to completely natural (as in before man started messing with everything) as possible - like something you might 'find' walking through the wilderness  PLEASE don't include any of these blatantly unnatural processes under the category of 'organic'  Thanks, Forrest
