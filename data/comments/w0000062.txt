comment = Despite the current exclusion of irradiation methods for product handling, whether being permitted or prhibited, I hope that careful consdieration is given to this issue in the very near future.  I view the use of irradiation as a very helpful tool in establishing and maintaining a safe food supply fo both organic and non-organic certified food products. Prohibiting irradiation for organic certification may jeopardize the emerging organic food industry. This would be a very unfortunate scenario for consumers and small family farms (the sector of agriculture that will benefit the most from establishing organic commodities markets).  Organic production, in most cases, will require the use of manures for optimizing plant production. While this will be a more sustainable agricultural practice, it will also create more of a threat of enteric bactera (i.e., e. coli, salmonella, etc.) contaminated produce, particularly for fresh vegatables and fruits. Irradiation does not leave any of its source residues on the target items, thus not adding any inorganic substances to the products. Maintaining a safe organic food supply will be much more difficult without the use of irradiation and could threaten the consumer and the organic production industry.
