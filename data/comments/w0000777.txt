comment = (my first portion of comments just disappeared - so forgive the resulting  lack of continuity). OF COURSE THINGS SHOULD BE LABELED, BUT IT SHOULD INCLUDE EVERYTHING AND  NOT JUST BE THE BURDEN OF THE ORGANIC FOLKS.  OBVIOUSLY, EVEN IF LABELED, CERTAIN CATEGORIES CANNOT FLY UNDER AN ORGANIC  BANNER. THIS INCLUDES GENETICALLY ENGINEERED SEEDS AND PRODUCE, CROPS AND  LIVESTOCK RAISED ON SLUDGE FERTILIZED LAND, IRRADIATED FOOD OR SEEDS.  tHE STANDARDS AS THEY ARE NEED TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. BETTER TO  WAIT AND LET THE CONSUMER KNOW THINGS ARE NOT YET DEFINITE, THAN GIVE THE ILLUSION THAT WE ARE PROTECTED - WHICH THE STANDARDS AS THEY ARE NOW WOULD DO.  Trina Paulus compostgal@aol.com
