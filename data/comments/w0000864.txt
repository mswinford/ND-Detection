comment = Certainly regulation and certification is a difficult  procedure. However having read a number of comments here it seems the  current USDA proposed rule does not have the confidence of  the consumer. Having read the proposed rule, it  appears its purpose is to specify a minimum level for the term organic.  Producers are currently able to readily sell their non-organic, or partly-organic products, as is, there is no need to officially  re-define organic to allow this. The effect then would be to render  the official label "organic" meaningless to the consumer.   Use the term as it is understood and intended by the public.  Organic does not imply the use of synthetics.  It does not imply genetically re-engineered foods.  It does not imply non-organic fertilizer.  It does not imply 80% organic. It does not imply organic for 90 days.   There is no such thing as a labeling "emergency".  If organic livestock face a food shortage, they  can merely become "non-organic". The "emergency" is a red-herring.   Perhaps it would do to allow "levels" of the term organic.  You might have organic grade C, B and A. Or Organic 80,  90 and 100. So far the proposed rule appears to need more work.   Thank you, Marina Peregrino
