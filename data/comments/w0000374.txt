comment = SHAME ON THE PEOPLE WHO CREATED THIS PROPOSAL!!  HOW DARE THEY TAKE A THRIVING INDUSTRY THAT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING FOOD THAT IS SAFE FOR PEOPLE AND SAFE FOR THE PLANET. THIS PROPSAL LETS IN SEVERAL DIFFERENT ASPECTS THAT RIPS AT THE VERY CORE OF THE ORGANIC MANIFEST. IRRADIATION AND GENETICALLY ALTERED HAVE NO PLACE IN ORGANIC. NIETHER DO ANTIBIOTICS FOR ANIMALS NOR DOES SEWER SLUDGE. WHO GOT PAID TO INCLUDE THIS THINGS. DOES ANYBODY ACTUAL BELIEVE THIS IS ORGANIC OR GOOD FOR THE CONSUMER TO EAT. I CHALLENGE YOU TO FIND ONE PERSON WHO BUYS ALL CERTIFED ORGANIC FOOD WHO SUPPORT THE INCLUSION OF TERMS. THIS IS APPALLING. THE OLD DEFINTION OF ORGANIC IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE AND IN LINE WITH THE CONSUMERS UNDERSTANDING OF ORGANIC TO BE SYNONOMUS WITH NATURAL. The following definition of "organic" was drafted and passed by the NOSB at their April 1995 meeting in Orlando, Florida. It was developed by a joint NOSB/National Organic Program task force, and incorporates language from the Codex Draft Guidelines for organically produced foods. This definition is being distributed for your information. Organic agriculture is an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain and enhance ecological harmony. "Organic" is a labeling term that denotes products produced under the authority of the Organic Foods Production Act. The principal guidelines for organic production are to use materials and practices that enhance the ecological balance of natural systems and that integrate the parts of the farming system into an ecological whole. Organic agriculture practices cannot ensure that products are completely free of residues; however, methods are used to minimize pollution from air, soil and water. Organic food handlers, processors and retailers adhere to standards that maintain the integrity of organic agricultural products. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people.   If this propsal passes it will erode the organic industry people such as myself who truely strive to eat pure heathly natural food will be forced to grow our own and carry it around with us because we know that the label "organic" would be worthless. ask people who eat organic foods the will tell you many things in this propsal are far to lax or have aboslutely no place in the organic industry.
