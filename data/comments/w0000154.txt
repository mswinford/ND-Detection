comment = Under NO circumstance do I want to have genetically engineered livestock or any irradiated products considered acceptable for the "organic" foods  labeling.  I also think that livestock feed should be regulated to prevent the livestock from being fed "recycled" animal by-prodcuts.   Livestock that is considered organic should be treated with the barest minimum  of hormones & antibiotics. Personally, I'd rather have them receive no  hormones of any kind.  Living conditions for livestock should also be addressed in any proposal that  is made to deem foods "organic".
