comment = I don't want irradiated food and bio-engineered food labels to go under the term organic. I want the food to say what it is. Organic should be free of pesticides, not grown in sludge and free of additives and preser- vatives. I have an allergic daughter and it is very hard to find foods that don't cause her to go into itching fits. I wish you could make the food processors not put in artificial ingredients. How about food that was made before refined sugar and partially hydrogenated oils? Thanks, Jessica Makowski
