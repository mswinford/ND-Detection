comment = i am VERY against including anything genetically engineered, irradiated, or fertilized with sewage under the heading of organic. this proposed bill is supposed to protect and educate the consumer, not encompass and protect illegimate means of farming. organic should be somewhat synonymous with natural...the way it was intended. and this IS from an engineering point of view :)
