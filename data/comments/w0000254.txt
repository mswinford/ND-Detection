comment = Please do not allow the use of GEO's in organic products! We consumers have come to depend on the label, "organic", to mean food grown without the use of synthetic processes; food that has developed as "naturally" as possible.   Every little synthetic process we add to this development takes us further from the purity of nature. I know of very negative results from man's interference with natural production--especially in the area of pharmocology and other industries. We have enough to contend with: global warming, air and water polution, etc. Many of these problems have been greatly contributed to by companies such as Monsanto, etc. that are major players in genetic engineering.   I, as consumer, mother, active community member, small business owner, and caring citizen absolutely DO NOT support the use of any genetically engineered or other synthetic products in the growing of the food we eat. I already buy almost exclusively from our local health food store. And I avoid purchasing from any company I know uses biogenetic engineering.   I have a right to know exactly what I am putting in my body and the bodies of members of my family. How can I KNOW if food labels do not tell me all the facts. I depend on the "organic" label and want to be able to continue depending on it.   Sincerely,  Cindy Ballou Fairfield, Iowa
