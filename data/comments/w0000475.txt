comment = As a consumer with multiple food allergies and chemical sensitivities, it is crucial to my health and safety that the final rule prohibit the use of genetically engineered organisms in organic produce. With allergies to milk and corn (as well as many other foods) it is already a nightmare to obtain foods that are free of these products, since labelling laws do not require full disclosure of food contents. Organic produce is one of the few categories of foods I can trust to be both free of chemical triggers and unadulterated. If you allow genetic engineering of organic food crops, I will no longer be able to trust this food source, since a food, such as soybeans, that should be safe for me to eat, might contain and express genes derived from corn that could render it deadly to me. In addition to thus contaminating my food supply, determining which foods were safe for me to eat would go from merely torturous to impossible. On behalf of the millions of Americans with food allergies, I implore you to disallow any form of genitic manipulation to food certified as organic.
