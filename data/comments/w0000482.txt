comment = I applaud the standardization effort as a whole and also the availability of this forum for consumer comments. My concerns are shared by many I'm sure. They include the following:  1) Irradiation - How can any process with the reputed ability to modify chemical structures in the food it treats even have a place in organic standardization discussions?  2) Genetic Engineering - Prohibit genetic engineering in every phase of the organic food chain.   3) Use of municipal sewage sludge as organic fertilizer - No human waste tissue please.  Basically I think what constitutes 'organic' is pretty simple. It must be natural from beginning to end and be labelled as such. I realize that you are under extreme pressure from many conflicting sources, but stand firm. Can there realy be an argument concerning the above three points?  Thank you for this opportunity to air my concerns.
