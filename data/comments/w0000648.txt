comment = Dear USDA:  I feel very strongly that the following procedures SHOULD NOT be per- mitted in the guidelines for growing organic food: A) bio-genitically altered produce or animal products, B) irradiated produce or animal products C)crops fertilized with sewage sludge, treated or untreated.  As a consumer who purchases organic produce almost exclusively, I do not want to consume products that have been grown by any of the above methods. I hope that your guidelines will mirror the stringent guidelines in place in California.  Most sincerely,   Stephen Hoyt
