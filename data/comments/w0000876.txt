comment = My family has been committed to organic food for some years, for three main reasons: 1)Organic farming causes considerably less environmental degradation that chemical-intensive farming; 2)organic food protects us from ingesting a variety of chemicals whose effects are harmful or questionable, and provides more nutrients; 3) organic farming is more safer for farm workers and humane to livestock and poultrAlthough a national standard for organic food is a good idea, I fear that a standard that is weak will undermine the organic food industry and the above mentioned benefits it offers to people and the environment.  Of particular concern: --The percentage of nonorganic ingredients allowed in organic foods should be very low, no more than 5%, to keep consumer confidence high in the products as well as to encourage growth of organic farming techniques which benefit the environment. --The proposal to allow foods with considerable non-organic content to use the term organic in their labeling should be eliminated from the final rules. Such labeling would be very confusing to the public, creating the perception that "organic" doesn't really mean anything.  --Irradiation should not be allowed for organic foods. Many citizens as well as scientists question the long-term safety of irradiating foods, which alters their chemical structure and produces carcinogens. Citizens need an alternative, a supply of natural foods, minimally manipulated. --Genetically altered organisms should be prohibited, for the same reasons. --Use of sewage sludge and municipal wastes for fertilizer should also be prohibited--it would compromise consumer confidence of safety and purity.
