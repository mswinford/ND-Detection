comment = I am a holistic health consultant and promote eating organic foods for a healthy lifestyle. At a minimum, the following should be addressed in the proposed rules:  1) Prohibit genetic engineering in every phase of the organic food  chain--not only GE seeds, but GE (or GE-derived) fertilizers or other  agricultural inputs, and foods produced from GE sources or using GE  processing agents or their derivatives (e.g., rennets, enzymes such as alpha  amylase, etc.).    2) Irradiation should be prohibited under the organic label. It fosters  continued reliance on nuclear technologies in general, and simply doesn't fit  into the traditional organic orientation. It has been likened to genetic  engineering in its reputed ability to modify chemical structures in the food  it treats, particularly creating novel proteins, whose bioactivity is  completely unknown and unpredictable.    3) Use of municipal sewage sludge as organic fertilizer should be banned.  Quite aside from the human waste issue, organic accreditation boards have  decried sewage as contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead,  which are readily absorbed by many crops.    4) All organic livestock should receive feed which was grown and processed  without use of genetic engineering, irradiation, and municipal sewage sludge.  (This is particularly important to dairy consumers.)    5) The definition of organic should be determined by concensus among those  who have been growing, eating, selling, and promoting organic food over the  long term--not by industrial ambitions or popular vote. At a minimum,  organic implies *natural from start to finish*. Diluting the meaning of  organic is a crime against nature and a crime against consumers who have  demonstrated a burgeoning interest in organic products.
