comment =  1. Regulation of organic agricultural products is a good idea. About 30-60 Percent of my fruit and vegetable purchases are organic, depending on the season.  2. I am against including genetically altered and irradiated products under the umbrella of the organic products designation.  3. Fresh animal manure should not be allowed to be used on organic crops, particularly leaf crops, due the possible occurrence of toxic strains of E. coli.  4. There should be a separate designation for "pesticide-free" produce and regulation of this category of vegetable produce, in addition to the organic designation. My greatest concern about modern farm practices is the health risk of pesticides on the consumer of pesticide-treated produce. Although I would prefer to purchase produce that has been grown with organic fertilizers, my greatest concern is with the health risk of pesticide residues on fruits and vegetables. My local health food stores and farmers markets sell organic produce and also sell pesticide-free produce. The pesticide-free vegetables are often more affordable than organic vegetables. This would provide more alternatives for the consumer of fresh produce.  Thank you for allowing me to comment on this legislation. Please put me on the mailing list for updates on the status of this Rule. I am: Joan Herskowitz, 1175 Kildeer Court, Encinitas, CA 92024.
