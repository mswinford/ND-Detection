comment = It is entirely clear that the proposed legislation is designed to benefit agribusiness to the detriment of the small organic farmer. The loopholes built into the proposal are big enough to drive a tanker of pesticide through. My objections to the list of permissible additives alone would more than fill this page, and my objections to the use of processed human waste, genetic engineering and irradiation would fill several more.  Most especially, I insist that if the several state legislatures are enlightened enough to establish meaningful production, processing and labeling requirements for food, which are more stringent than those of the USDA, then those state laws should prevail, and no imported goods that fail to meet these standards should not be labeled or sold as organic.  It is quite obvious that you folks are "unclear on the concept" of organic foods. That, or you just want to hand Agribusiness yet another plum - bioengineered, chemically sprayed and irradiated.
