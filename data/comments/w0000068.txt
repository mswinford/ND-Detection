comment = I congratulate you on this first draft. But I cannot find anywhere mention of genetic manipulation or irradiation as disqualifiers for any food product claiming the ORGANIC FOOD label. As a consumer I wouldn't be able to trust a label which does not include clear statements about such high-tech procedures applied at any point of the food production. From the environmental impact point of view, a ORGANIC label without specific mention of processes applied to the source seed of the farm product, or to the packaging and handling of the harvest would miss the target of the intended environmental benefits of the labeling program. These (non-human) benefits are as large a consideration as the health related ones.  Congratulations on this use of the Internet for the gathering of reactions to your regulatory activity. It makes me feel government CAN work!
