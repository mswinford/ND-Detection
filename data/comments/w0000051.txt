comment = In your proposed organic rules the fee structure is not clear to me. I am a VERY small operation and any fees can make the difference between making and losing money. I also find it ironic that if I chose to farm in an irresponsible manner, damaging the environment and health of our citizens, I could be subsidized by the government. If I want to advertize that I am a responsible, organic grower, I owe the government money.
