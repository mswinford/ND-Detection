comment = If a seed is treated with pesticides, how can the plant be truly organic? There seems to be no distinction made in labeling between origin and culture. This would also seem to allow for genetically engineered plants, esp. the big loophole that says if no comparable organic variety exists, they can use the nonorganic variety. If a variety is specifically engineered, then of course there will be none other like it, and it may be used. Please don't muck about with DNA--but if you have to, for God's sake don't call it organic!!! I suggest two components to organic labeling, that reflect the difference in the origin of plants and how they are grown. "Organically grown" and "Organic in origin" should both be on the foods that I buy. To label something synthetically engineered as organic is deceptive, to say the least.
