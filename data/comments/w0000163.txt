comment = Glad to see that your department is setting standards for organic produce. Please make the standards as rigorous as possible. A group to contact for information is the Rodale Institute, Kutztown, PA. The people there have done much research and field work in growing purely organic food.  I would not consider food organic if it were grown with fertilizer from hazardous waste because the contaminants they contain will get into the plants and then into human consumers of the plants.  Hazardous waste might include human waste which contains contaminants such as heavy metals. Certain industrial byproducts which are not officially designated as hazardous waste are used as fertilizer. This would be inappropriate fertilizer for organic produce. There are different rules in different states for these different byproducts/wastes. Some of these may be considered hazardous waste in their home state but are then shipped out to other states where they are not deemed hazardous and can be used as fertilizers. Thanks again for the new organic rules.  Sincerely, Stewart Galloway P.O. Box 566 Round Lake, NY 12151 518-899-6426 stewart_galloway@mclaren-hart.com
