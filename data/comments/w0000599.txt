comment =   I object to allowing genetically engineered seeds to be used for the production of organic foods. I do not feel that the methods and materials used for such food production is in keeping with the spirit of organic foods. I do not feel that the health risks of such methods have been studied adequately and for a long enough period of time to warrant their use at all, not to mention in organic foods. As a physician and a consumer, I have grave concerns for such food production, in terms of human and animal health. I am further concerned on the impact on our environment and our biodiversity.
