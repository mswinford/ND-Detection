comment =  I would like to see all genetically engineered  foods labeled as such so that I can choose not to consume them in any  form.  I do not personally consider genetically engineered or altered foods to  be truly "organic", and wish to have the choice not to consume them myself, or feed them to my children.  The lack of long-term studies and research into the effects of these genteically engineered food upon human, animals and the environment is disturbing, and I believe it to be potentially hazardous.  Every consumer should have full knowledge of the origins of their foods and ingredients, and be allowed to make educated, informed decisions concerning their consumption.
