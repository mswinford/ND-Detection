comment =  Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them. In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so that I can choose not to consume them in any form. I also am a vegetarian by choice and if animal genes are allowed to be used in the foods that I eat then I will participate in any and all legal action that will be made in support of those of us whose legal rights have been violated to have the freedom to select those foods that we want to consume. It should also be noted that genes that contain genes of items that individuals have allergic reactions to are not only dangerous to consumers but potentially lethal. How can the USDA possibly introduce foods that could potentially cause death.
