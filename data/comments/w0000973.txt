comment = THE PROPOSED RULE IS SO FLAGRENTLY INTENDED TO DO HARM THAT IT SHOULD BE  STOPPED OR SUSPENDED IMMEADIATELY 1/10/98.THE ORGANIC TRADE ASSOCIATION,   THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE NOSB ROBERT B. ANDERSON,AND OTHERS IN LEADERSHIP  IN THE ORGANIC FARM FIELD HAVE THE OBLIGATION TO CALL THIS DOCUMENT   EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.  EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE DOCUMENT AS IT IS WRITTEN 12/15/97 IS AN   ATTEMPT TO KILL THE ORGANIC FARM MODEL AS WEVE GROWN TO KNOW IT OVER   40 YEARS.ITS A THEFT. ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THEFT.ITS A FRAUD.  ITS A CRIMINAL ACT. AND ITS DELIVERED WITH MALICE.  ITS TIME TO STOP ASKING FOR EXTENDED COMMENT PERIODS AND DEMAND THAT   THE DOCUMENT BE HALTED BECAUSE ITS A HARMFULL POINT TO START.  AND THOSE OF YOU IN THE POWER POSITIONS IN THE ORGANIC TRADE WHO FAIL TO   DECLARE THE USDA AND GLICKMAN DOCUMENT TO BE A OK STARTING POINT ARE DOING   HARM TO ORGANIC CONSUMER,FARMER,AND FOOD HANDLERS.  YOUR OBLIGATION IS SELF EVIDENT.  ORGANIC FAMILIES EXPECT AND DESERVE BETTER LEADERSHIP THAN HAS BEEN   DEMONSTRATED SO FAR.  KATHRINE DEMATIO AND THE ORGANIC TRADE ASSOCIATION STILL HAVE NO   POSTION PAPER. WHOS SIDE ARE THEY ON? COME ON EVERYONE TELL US   EXACTLY WHER YOU STAND ON THIS VITAL ISSUE.IMMEADIATELY!!!  I DECLARE THE USDA PROPOSED ORGANIC STANDARDS RULE TO BE CRIMINALLY  EVIDENT BEYOND DEFENCE;BY EITHER ORGANIC OR CONVENTIAL FARM WORKING  PEOPLE.DAN GLICKMAN SHOULD BE RUN OUT OF TOWN, AND NEVER SHOULD THIS  CRIMINAL CHARACTER BE ALLOWED NEAR AN AGRICULTURAL JOB,EVER AGAIN.
