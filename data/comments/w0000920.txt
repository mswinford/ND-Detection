comment = To Whom It May Concern;  I urge you in the strongest possible sense to reconsider the proposed National Organic Standards. The proposal represents nothing less than an unfriendly take-over of the growing natural foods industry by agribusiness, chemical-biotech corporations, and giant supermarket chains. As usual, the average consumer, the environment, and our nation's livestock pay the price.  I am in favor of maintaining strict organic standards by explicitly prohibiting the following: genetic engineering, factory farming, the use of toxic sludge, animal cannibalism (ie, the cause of mad cow disease), and food irradiation. I also believe that you should allow private and state organic certification bodies to maintain stricter organic standards than those the USDA requires.   At the very least, this is a basic issue of free speech and of consumers' right to choose. In a more general sense, it is about assuring the future of our food supply and the sustainability of our social and natural environments. Please, do the right thing, for once.
