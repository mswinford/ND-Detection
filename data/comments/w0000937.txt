comment = I commented once before, however, after being further educated on certain topics would like to resubmit my remarks.  re: Sewage Sludge. I am against its use because it is munincipal waste and may contain any toxic substance people have put down their drains. Using sludge as fertilizer does not either require farmers to grow cover crops and conserve and rest soils, which underscore certain principals behind organic farming.   I see your new lax regulations as ways for big agribusiness to pass their produce off as organic when it is still grown by esentially conventional methods. This undermines all the hard work, principals and ethics of organic farmers. Organic farmers retrieve higher prices for their food because they cannot farm as intensively and produce as much on the same scale.   Please let's not let yet another branch of government become corrupt by big money interests. Some things are more important.  I prey you're listening.
