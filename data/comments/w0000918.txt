comment = Janury 9, 1998  Mark Lipson Molino Creek Farming Collective PO Box 69 Davenport CA 95017  Eileen Stommes Assistant Deputy Administrator USDA-AMS-TMD-NOP  RE: 7 CFR, Part 205 (DOCKET NUMBER: TMD-94-00-2)  Dear Ms. Stommes,  I am writing to request that AMS extend the comment period on the proposed rules for organic foods standards. In addition to length and complexity of the proposed rule itself, the Department has made more than 40 separate requests for data and information regarding aspects of the organic foods industry and the potential impacts of various portions of the rule. As the Department found, much of this data is not readily available. Attempting to satisfy these data requests will require an extensive effort and the existing comment period is inadequate. Any resulting delay in implemenation will be well worth the opportunity to better understand the proposal and contribute the requested data. It would be helpful to know the status of any possible extension as soon as possible. Thank you for your consideration of this request.
