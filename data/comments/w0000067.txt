comment = I am writing in response to USA TODAY newspaper article on organic food. I was raised on wholesome, unadulterated food, mostly grown by my parents on an acre of land. I tried very hard to provide my children with the most pure and natural food possible by reading labels, shopping at organic farms and raising the few berries and veggies I could in my small garden. I strongly feel that our food, air and water pollution is the cause of so many illness in this country. I am all for organically grown food, even if I have to pay a little more. I do not feel sewage sludge, irradiation and genetically engineered food should be allowed in the organic labeling. What about all the hormones (birth control pills, HRT, antibotics and toxic chemicals)that will be found in the sewage sludge)? I will not buy or eat irradiate food or genetically engineered food. We take lots of antioxidant vitamins and have for at least 25 years. Thank God we are basically healthy - quite unlike the majority of Americans.  We need to clean up our food supply and have true organic foods.  Thank you for the opportunity to respond to this important matter. Mary Derstine  e-mail: mderstine@nac.net
