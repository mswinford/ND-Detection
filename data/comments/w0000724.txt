comment = As a consumer, I'm very concerned about the watering-down of organic agriculture which will be the ultimate result of implementation of the rules as proposed here. Many processes and substances will be allowed which would not be considered by a reasonable person to be included in "organic farming." No weakening should be permitted which simply allow corporate agriculture to horn in on a market niche that meets a real consumer need. The regulations as proposed allow large producers to get into this market by compromising the quality of the products of "organic agriculture". The government, if standardizing is a goal, should maintain the high standards which the marketplace has set to date.
