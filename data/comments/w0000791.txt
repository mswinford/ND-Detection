comment = As a consumer of organic foods, I am extremely disturbed to learn of this government initiative to devalue organic certification in the interests of large agri-business. Techniques such as bioengineering, irradiation, and sludge-farming are clearly not within the commonly accepted usage of the term 'organic'. Although I am not a farmer, I gather from the comments of concerned organic farmers that these are only some of the more egregious instances of redefinition.  If the standard in this current, adulterated form were adopted, it would mean that consumers like myself would cease to have any confidence in organic labeling. I would have to restrict my purchases to only grocers that I trust to ignore the USDA guidelines and instead offer only wares that they believe are safe.  I sincerely hope that this standard will be _greatly_ strengthened, back to the carefully considered recommendations of the N.O.S.B.  FYI - I was alerted to this topic and site by the discussion program on KQED radio, San Francisco.
