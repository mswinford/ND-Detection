comment =  Unless the Organic Standards are absolutely strict, their adoption will be  the distruction of the slowly won gains of the organic movement to promote  confidence via the California standards etc. If the standards are not  strict they will mean nothing and be much worse than no national standards. During doubt let us keep what we have.  If any of the following elements are allowed, I, for one, will not buy from  stores or farmers that will not certify that they have NOT used these  products.   Organic food is the natural food of humans and animals. It should not be  seen as some newfangled invention. It is NOT rather chemical agriculture  that is the newcomer?   WHY ARE WE DOING THIS? WHY NOT HAVE EVERYONE LABEL EVERYTHING THAT GOES  INTO OUR SOIL OR FOOD? WHY IS NOT THE NATURAL (WHICH IS THE ORGANIC) BE  THE NORM? WHY NOT HAVE EVERYONE LIST THEIR INPUTS AND LET THE CUSTOMERS  DECIDE BASED ON TRUTHFUL LABELS?  NO SLUDGE - If a customer cannot be positive that no SLUDGE, which is  likely a toxic mix of street runoff, household sewage and industrial waste (with heavy  metals like lead,cadmium and mercury), has been applied to their food growning  land, where will their confidence be?  NO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED seeds, or foods - NONE! Even while the debate  is going on; even more, because it still is going on, a vast, unlabeled, unrecallable, genetic experiment is being conducted on ALL of us without  our consent. Genetically engineered food is being produced, sold and mixed  unlabeled into countless processed products. Food is even now being  changed forever. Our watchdog agencies claim safety and do nothing.  NO IRRADIATION - There is evidence that changes take place that are not  understood but appear to cause disease in too many.  ANIMAL CANNIBALISM - No food from another animal fed to annimals.  NO FACTORY FARMING -   This decision is too important to settle in 3 months - extend the period for comments.
