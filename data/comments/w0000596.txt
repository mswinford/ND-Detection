comment = Section 205.17b should prohibit food irradiation of products labeled as organic. The potential irradiation has to produce chemicals adverse to human health is too high to allow this practice in organic farming. It is not consistent with the concept of organic in most minds as something produced naturally, and to allow irradiated produce to be labeled as organic would be misleading.
