comment = Please state that the use of ionizing radiation is not compatible with a system of organic handling and farming. There are effective alternatives to ionizing radation, such as sanitary practices, and ionizing radation should not be considered an essential standard industry practice.An organic label should mean no use of ionizing radiation.
