comment = As a mother, it appalls me that the proposed rules would give the Agricultural Secretary the power to add synthetic and genetically-engineered chemicals to the list of products to be used on organic foods. This decision should be left up to an independent National Organics Board. I want organic food for my family. Sewage sludge is not safe fertilizer. I want to know if I am eating genetically engineered foods. I have been buying organic food for three years now. We are making ourselves sick in this country from our farming practices. I beleive genetically engineered foods, irradiated foods, and foods grown with sewage fertilzer and chemical fertilizer to be toxic. You may not agree with me, but I have the right to know how my food has been grown. I will continue to purchase all my produce directly from small organic farms I have direct contact with, but my concern is for the packaged products I buy:i.e. soy milk, grains, beans. Also, as a vegetarian, I choose to refrain from eating animals for ethical reasons, I therefore want to know which foods have been engineered with animal cells. It is a disgrace that the USA continues to make decisions which support business over the health of its citizens.    Sincerely,  Mari Short 1844 W. Berteau Chicago, IL 60613
