comment = Dear People,  I am very upset by the inclusion of irradiated foods in the proposed standards. I do not believe irradiated foods are safe, nor do I believe nuclear power is safe. I do not want to encourage the splitting of atoms at all, as the byproducts of such activity have been adequately demonstrated to be lethal and impossible to safely dispose of. Organic certification should mean that all practices used in production are Earth-friendly. Irradiation is toxic to life. It is very important that irradiated foods be labeled, so that as consumers we can make an informed choice about what to buy and eat.  I am also very opposed to the allowing of genetically altered crops. There has been almost no testing of these products. Many of them are altered to make them more tolerant of dangerous pesticides. How, I ask you, is that supposed to reduce the use of those chemical pesticides?? If some farmers want to experiment with bizarre life forms, they should be carefully regulated, and the food containing these experiments should be carefully labeled so that consumers can make a choice about whether we want to participate in these experiments.
