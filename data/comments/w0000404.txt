comment = As a buyer of organic product, I very strongly want to buy food that has not been irradiated, grown with sewage, or designed with biotechnology. I feel that the USDA would be doing Americans a great disservice by allowing mass produced food that does not meet such requirements to be made indistinguishable by the consumer to food that has met higher standards.  Thank you for giving us the choice to buy what we want with accurate and consistent labeling.
