comment = I am an organic consumer and have great concerns about any synthetic processes or products being allowed in the proposed organic definition. I buy organic foods to avoid irradiation, biotechnically engineered food and the use of antibiotics. If these were allowed under the organic label I would not buy organic. I can not allow myself to feed my child conventionally grown food. The only option would be starvation or growing my own.
