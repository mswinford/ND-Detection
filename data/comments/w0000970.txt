comment =  Congratulations for bringing our nation to the point of recognizing the importance of formulating a law designed for the purpose of protecting consumers of organic products from fraud. As Americans are increasingly realizing, we have the right to know how our food is grown.  While I support this momentous occurance, I have several concerns about what I see as omissions from this proposed law. The proposal has not ruled out the use of irradiation and genetic engineering for foods labeled organic, nor has it excluded the use of sewage sludge on organic crop land.   Irradiation, genetic engineering, and sewage sludge do not belong in organic production systems. Please add my concerns to the discussion about these issues, and inform me about other ways to make sure my voice is heard. Janet Paisley
