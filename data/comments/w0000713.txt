comment = I am concerned by publicity on this rule that one of the fundamental intents of organic farming --- reducing chemical environmental pollution  caused by farming --- may be violated. I am not personally concerned about the trace elements of pesticide that may be resident in food I eat, but I care deeply about the 98% of farming chemicals that become resident instead in the environment, killing local ecosystems and causing long term soil and water pollution which gradually increases the levels of toxins we are exposed to every day.  I hope that the consideration of what substances may be on the national list will be left in the hands of the organization with the environment and the farmers who live and work with it as their primary concern, presumably the National Organic Standards Board.
