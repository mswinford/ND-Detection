comment = I am registering my opposition to allowing genetically-engineered or irradiated food to be labeled as "organic." Given the USDA's past support for chemically-based agriculture, I would personally view any attempt to broaden the definition of organic foods to include these categories as an attempt to weaken and sabotage the thriving organic foods industry. As a consumer of organic foods, I feel that my health would be compromised by such a definition, and my choices made less clear and ultimately, more limited.
