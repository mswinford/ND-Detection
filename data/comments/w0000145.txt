comment = I apologize if these comments fall into another more specific area.  First of all, let me express my thanks and appreciation for the development and work that went into this proposal. I have not yet read the rule in it's entirety, but am an organic foods consumer and see the need AND value of such a rule, both to myself, the environment and the market.  Secondly, more specifically, I would like to express my feelings on the consideration of allowing genetic engineering of foods. I would prefer that genetically engineered foods NOT be able to be sold as organic, the evolution process has worked for a long time and I prefer to have organic mean 'as evolved' as it were. I understand that genetic engineering has benefits, but would prefer that foods in this category are clearly labelled as such, and NOT labelled as the foods I now considered safest for myself and my environment.   Thanks for taking time to read my comments.
