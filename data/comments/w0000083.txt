comment = I strongly oppose the proposed rules for organics as currently written. As a business person, an educator, and a cancer patient, I find the efforts of USDA laudable but seriously lacking in several key areas. Specifically:  1. States, such as Oregon, must be allowed to require out-of-state farm and food handling operations to comply with more stringent regulations beyond the national standards.  2. Organics may NOT include:  a. genetic engineering nor food irradiation  b. the use of sewage fertilizer or "biosolids"  c. non-organic seed and planting stock  d. the use of vaccinations, antibiotics, or other drugs  e. the application of synthetic or other "dormant" substances on crops  f. use of synthetic rodent and insect poisons.  Clearly, the rules are intended to satisfy the industry and agrobusiness rather than the consumer. Therefore, I encourage a strengthening of the rules as indicated above.  Until such time, I will continue to buy only goods certified by Oregon Tilth, which are considerably more strict - and healthier - than those that would be available under the proposed guidelines.
