comment = I would like to say that I’m not opposed to the National Organic Program and the establishment of national standards relating to "Organic" foods.  I have been reading the general comments submitted to you by my fellow consumers. I would also like to express my believes that irradiated and genetically altered foods should not be labeled "Organic". Also food grown with treated waste (sludge) as a fertilizer should be prohibited from displaying the label "Organic".    We as consumers have the right to know how the foods we put into are body was produced. Please make the "Organic”" label MEANINGFUL. Don’t let big agribusiness and the chemical industry with all their money and influence degrade the meaning of "Organically" produced foods.   Thank-You  Joe Harrah
