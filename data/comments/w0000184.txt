comment = As a long time consumer of organic produce and a strong beliver in the movement, I am pleased that the government is taking steps to insure the quality of the food I eat. However, I was distressed to learn through the newspaper account of the proposed regulations that bio-engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation are not being considered at this time. I am writing to express my grave concerns that the omission of those practices from the discussion keeps the door open for their future use in my food supply—an idea I am absolutely against. As far as I am concerned, when I buy organic produce, I am voting with my dollars for more than just pesticide-free food; I am making a conscious choice for a more livable planet, a more rational economy, and a more balanced relationship with nature. Seen from a larger perspective, I believe organic produce really represents a small step in changing the consciousness of the people of this world for the better. Bio-engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation may seem like good ideas to some people, but in my opinion, they are really steps backward, if not outright dangers. We don't need genetically-altered food, we need a fairer food distribution system; we won't solve excess waste by turning it into fertilizer, we need to consume less; and we certainly don't need more nuclear facilities in this country, we need more local farms to insure the freshness of our food supply. In conclusion, I wish to express my opinion that in your final report the definition of what is organic should include the prohibition of bio-engineering, sewage sludge, and irradiation in the production and delivery of organic food. Thank you for your consideration of my views as a concerned citizen. 		 									Sincerely, 									Stephen Gentile 									Bronx, New York 									December 17, 1997
