comment = It is not acceptable to allow the use of genetically engineered crops, animals or inputs in organic farming.  This position has already been established in organic standards in other countries, including EU member states.  It is unlikely that EU countries will permit the import of organic products which include gmos, as this will undermine their own standards and place their own farmers at a potential economic disadvantage.  If the US permits gmos in its own organic produce, then US organic growers are likely to be denied access to the growing global markets for organic foods.
