comment = 	The term "organic" should exclude all irradiated foodstuffs, and should also exclude all foodstuffs derived from geneteically engineered organisms. Both irradiation and geneteic engineering have the potential to alter foods, and the potential harm of such alterations is not well understood at this time. Irrespective of the potential hazards, foods so derived should be labeled as such to alert the consumer, and the consumer should feel safe that foods labeled as "organic" have not been altered by either of the above methods.
