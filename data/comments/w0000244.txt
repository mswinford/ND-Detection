comment =  RE: USDA's proposed regulations to implement legislation to The Organic Foods Production Act of 1990    I will be extremely happy to see these standards set. I purchase only organic products, and will give me piece of mind when making my purchases.  I would like to see the same care applied to alerting consumers as to which foods are irradiated. I will never knowingly purchase irradiated foods and would appreciate a standard which would assure me that I will know which foods have been subjected to the process of irradiation. I don't feel irradiation should be performed on anything that will be consumed by a living being. As long as irradiation is going to be condoned by this goverment, I want the freedom to make an intelligent choice not to ingest these poisoned products.  Thankyou Lynn Cremona
