comment = The proposed rule is shockingly weak. Practices that have been resoundingly rejected by respectible organic products producers and consumers (especially in California under CCOF) must not be reintroduced. This includes preventitive or preemptory antibiotics for livestock,  hormones for livestock, inorganic feed for livestock,  and irradiation.   Please do not produce a standard that commercial organizations with no philosophical or health interest in organics and food safety can use to masquerade as, and compete with, organizations that do fully  support and participate in the organic foods movement. Please create a level, and high, playing field with strict standards such that any accredited product can be consumed with confidence.  I urge you as strongly as possible to forcefuly reject antibiotics (expect in the treatment of  specific illnesses in specific animals), hormones, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, irradiation, and inorganic feed.   Please increase as far as possible the healthfullness of our food supply.
