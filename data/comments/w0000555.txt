comment = Needless to say I am stunned that this is something that needs to be discussed! The definition of "Organic" does not need to be changed or redefined by our government.   Organic should mean foods grown without pesticides, chemicals, irradiation, nonpure water etc. Perhaps if we went back to local growers that basically followed these parameters we would be offered pure foods ripen by the sun during their correct season that do not have a "perfect" appearance or last for three weeks devoid of nutritional content!  I use the 1800's farm analogy: pure soil, pure water and small crops that were grown for TASTE! Farmers that want to use their medicine bag of harmful pesticides, chemicals and irradiation can...it is called large grocery store produce and meat/fish/poultry...that is WHY I buy organic and do not eat meat anymore!   Please allow the organic farmers to cleanup our food supply as much as possible.   Please enable them to offer use food that nourishs us more then harms us.
