comment = Because I find your "subpart" sections confusing, I am submitting my comments on the proposed national orgranic program rule here.  I believe the program should have strict standards, definitions and prohibit the use of genetically altered seeds, fertilizers, livestock and end product food: produce, meat, grains, etc. Genetically altered seeds, fertilizers, livestock and end product food: produce, meat, grains, etc. are NOT organic.  The program should define and prohibit irradiated food. Irradiated food is NOT organic.  The program should also define and prohibit the use of synthetic, inorganic, chemically altered fertilizers, such as sewage sludge (complete with industrial effluents) and maneuer (ie the feces of livestock).
