comment = Concerning National Organic Program Proposed Rule:  It is critical to the health of the people of the United States as well as to the health of the food industry that genetically engineered, pesticide sprayed, and toxically fertilized food not become part of the organic food standard.  The use of pesticides is especially troubling to me.  In section § 205.9 Prevention and control of crop pests, weeds, and diseases. There are essentially no functional restrictions on the use of pesticides.  In sub-section (a) of section § 205.9 the phrase 'Pests, weeds, and diseases in crops shall be prevented by practices including, but not limited to:' provides me with no protection.  In sub-section (d) and (e) of section § 205.9 this already inadequate statement is weakened further.  So far, I have been willing to pay more for these crops. If the organic food standard is compromised, I will not.  Please uphold my ability to CHOOSE truly organic food.    Concerned Citizen,  Sean Vikoren
