comment = PLEASE, keep the standards high for the foods that are labeled "Organic". I buy 'Organic' specifically because I feel assured that me and my family are getting foods that have NOT been chemically treated, processed, or have chemical additives. I buy 'Orgainically' grown produce and meats - because they don't have pesticides or hormones or steroids induced into them and have been treated humanely.   I depend upon the 'Organic' label to tell me that the food I buy won't have any chemical agents that I or my family may be allergic to.
