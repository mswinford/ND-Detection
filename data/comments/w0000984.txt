comment = I do not support the use of genetic engineering or irradiation in the production or processing  of organic foods. Furthermore, I am definitely opposed to using sewage sludge until a high  quality filtering system is in place that will filter out damaging heavy metals. The earth  belongs to each and every one of us, please do what is best for all of us.
