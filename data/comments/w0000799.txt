comment = Please prohibit genetically engineered and irradiated foods from being labeled organic. This is part of the generally understood meaning of the word organic. To create an organic standard that does not specifically prohibit genetic engineering and irradiation would be a deception of the public, and would render the word "organic" meaningless.
