comment = I support and value organic farming primarily because of its positive environmental impact (or at least the lack of negative impact) and secondarily because of concern for the lifestyles and incomes of farm workers.  For both reasons, I am highly concerned by the following allegation  taken from David Briar's posting to the internet newsgroup misc.activist.progressive:  "It [the national organic program proposed rule] violates the intent and spirit of the Act to encourage and promote organic family farming and small businesses by proposing excessive fees and by promulgating a Proposed Rule wildly out of conformance to OFPA. "  Family farming and small business increase the probability of pride and care put into the produce and land, and that hired workers are properly treated. For us as consumers, it is absolutely the right compromise between economics and environmentalism to spend our money on service and quality rather than quantity. Further, the farmers who choose to dedicate their lives to positive rather than negative environmental impact should be supported in their efforts, at least to the level of being allowed to take the prices the market allows for their goods, without worry of excessive fees.
