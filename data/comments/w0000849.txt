comment = I was outraged when the US government made it illegal to label products that don't use Bovine Growth Hormone (BGH). How do I know if cheese was made from milk produced from BGH cows? BGH is one of the most odious of things I can think of having in my food! Yet, I can't even have the choice to not buy it in a regular supermarket.  Having it illegal to label products that don't use BGH is not only against the amendment for freedom of expression, it is not allowing consumers freedom of knowing what we consume. I believe that it should be required that dairies that use BGH list it on their products, not vice versa.
