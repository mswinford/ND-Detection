comment = NO SLUDGE - If a customer cannot be positive that no SLUDGE, which is  likely a toxic mix of street runoff, household sewage and industrial waste (with heavy  metals like lead,cadmium and mercury), has been applied to their food growning  land, where will their confidence be?  NO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED seeds, or foods - NONE! Even while the debate  is going on; even more, because it still is going on, a vast, unlabeled, unrecallable, genetic experiment is being conducted on ALL of us without  our consent. Genetically engineered food is being produced, sold and mixed  unlabeled into countless processed products. Food is even now being  changed forever. Our watchdog agencies claim safety and do nothing.  NO IRRADIATION - There is evidence that changes take place that are not  understood but appear to cause disease in too many.  NO ANTIBIOTICS for crops or livestock.  ANIMAL CANNIBALISM - No food from another animal fed to animals.  NO FACTORY FARMING - but sustainable agriculture.  Are we talking about organic or what???
