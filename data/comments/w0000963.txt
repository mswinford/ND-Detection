comment =  Eileen S. Stommes Deputy Administrator USDA-AMS-TM-NOP Room 4007-So. Ag stop 0275 RE:: Proposed Organic Rule, Docket # TMD-94-00-2  To whom it may concern,,  	Established bureaucracy that claim to work toward a better society while they compete one another in order to maximize net profit, weather their own or corporate is hypocrisy. As a college student I see our race ever more idiocentric as we approach the 21st century. Today I was “surfing” the American Institute of Cancer research web page and I found it hard to avoid the outdated trend of prevention and or treatment through diet and nutrition. Now here we have the AICR which strives to find a cure for cancer and better our future; on the other hand we have the USDA which seems to be working in a manner that would only hinder the very essence of the AICR’s work.  	I write this letter to promote a more cosmic conscious philosophy and decision making policy. On a more microscopic level I am concerned about the potential risks involved with the introduction of GEO’s to organic farming in the states. I like my corn just the way it is right now off the cob...I don’t want GEO’s in my corn, I think it’s that simple. Not to mention the demise of our organic farming industry, and whatever adverse environmental effect such a course of action will have. And where does that leave the AICR when everyone is eating something that came from a beaker?  Yours, Kambiz Tavabi
