comment = Dear Friends at USDA, Thank you for trying to establish national standards for organic foods. The organic farming movement is important for its determination to protect the health of the soil, air and water that we need to raise food, as well as protecting the health of the farmers and workers who raise it, harvest it and sell it and of course in ensuring a supply of healthy, nutritious food to those of us who eat.  Unfortunately, your proposed standards threaten to undermine those principles of health and sustainability.  DO NOT allow the use of irradiation; "natural" but poisonous compounds such as nicotine and arsenic; genetically engineered organisms; use of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer, which could possibly introduce heavy metals and other poisons such as PCBs; nor, less than 100 percent processed organic produce to still be labeled "organic."  I trust the label "organic" to mean grown without synthetic chemicals, pesticides or other non-natural treatments. Consumer Reports analyzed produce labelled organic and found significantly less pesticide residue than conventionally grown produce. Those of us who eat need to be certain that our food is raised as promised.  Please set your standards at a high level, modelling them on California or Oregon standards would be acceptable. Force large agribusiness producers to raise their standards and change their practices. The whole point of organic food is to farm in a way that preserves our current and future health. Large businesses can transform the way they farm, if given the challenge and the education. The USDA should be leading the way in causing that transformation. Don't allow yourselves to destroy the term "organic" by selling out to big agribusiness.
