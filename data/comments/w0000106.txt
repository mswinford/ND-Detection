comment = Other similar guidelines or rules are still used in fraudulent ways to decieve the public for whatever reasons. For example, you may see something like "100% Natural" in large letters on a label below which in very much smaller type "used in this product". If you do not look closely, it is easy to assume it is 100% Natural.  Please consider carefully how the manufacturers, suppliers, packagers etc. will use their "creativity" to pervert the rules you make regarding clear labelling on this issue.  For example, you may consider that if the word "Organic" is used anywhere on the label, then any requirement to have the word "Inorganic" as well MUST be in larger face type than the largest type used for the word "Organic".  Thank you very kindly for you consideration and let's get a little truth in labeling/advertising.
