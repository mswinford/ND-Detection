comment = I listened to a discussion of this Proposed Rule on National Public Radio this morning, and have a few comments.  I hope that the Proposed Rule WILL allow for improvements in crops and livestock that may come about through genetic engineering, or other parts of biotechnology in general, and still be labeled as Organic, if they otherwise could be labeled Organic. I view this technology as an extension of genetic selection like hybrids or simple animal husbandry.  I want the Proposed Rule to allow the market to decide if irradiation is acceptable or not. The labeling of Organic should be independant of labeling of irradiated. As long as both things are marked on the product, the consumer can decide to buy irradiated foods, or not, and to by Organic foods, or not. These two things should not be linked. That is, because a food is irradiated should not keep it from being labeled Organic. Just state both things on the label. Personally, I  believe irradiation is safe.  I am concerned about eliminating safe preservatives from some products. My fear is that spoiled foods are much more harmful than SAFE preserv- atives. An Organically produced food which has no preservatives is much more susceptible to spoilage. Perhaps the list of preservatives should be examined, and some subset of them that the experts can agree  on could be allowed in foods labeled Organic.  The third thing mentioned on the radio which I should comment about is the use of sewage sluge on crops labeled Organic. I can't make up my mind about this. I am not convinced that it is entirely safe, but I am not convinced that there is a real danger in its use. The use of  animal manures seems reasonable, but sewage sluge is similar, but not entirely the same.
