comment = As a private citizen of the uSA, I prefer to eat organically grown foods. Lack of variety, availability, and sometimes price are a hindrance. Developing certifiable standards should alleviate some or all of these conditions.  I feel very strongly about being given the opportunity to choose, via a certified label, food for puchase that is free of irradiation, free from non-plant genetic engineering and grown without the use of sewage sludge.  I find it disturbing that the USDA would consider labeling a food organic that has been subjected to any of the above processes.
