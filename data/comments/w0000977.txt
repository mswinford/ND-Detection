comment =   I would oppose any laws that would allow genetically   engineered foods to be labeled organic. I believe that   this makes it harder for organic farmers to fight   certain pests by causing them to become resistant   to the substances that organic farmers can use.   I am opposed to the use of irradiation on any food   especially organic food. There are several other    ways for our food sources to be treated that are a   lot safer. I am opposed to the use of sewage sludge   being used of organic crop land. It often contains   toxic heavy metals and other contaminants.   Thank you   Suzanne Rehbock
