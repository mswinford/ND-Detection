comment = Please do not allow organic livestock producers to use growth hormones, and overcrowd animals or keep them in unsanitary conditions so that they require high doses of antibiotics. I also think that organic livestock should be biologically fit, i.e. not turkeys that are so disproportionately large that they aren't capable of mating on their own. Organic growers should not be able to use a large portion of manure from livestock producers that overcrowd and overmedicate their animals, and be fed a certain percentage of organically grown feed; I'm not sure what percentage would be fair to all, but it would be good to encourage the production and sale of organic feed.
