comment =  I oppose the use of biotechnology, irradiation and sludge in the production, processing, transport, etc. of organic foods.  While I wholeheartedly welcome and encourage rules standardizing the use of the term "organic," I think it is irresponsible and unethical to allow anything to be termed organic which has been genetically altered, cloned, irradiated, or processed beyond the conventional means of husbandry, breeding, and/or horticultural.  Irradiated food, is changed molecularly (particularly, red meat, although other food products are changed as well). To pass such meat, grains, spices, and/or vegetables as "organic" is deceptive and disingenuous.  I am against food being irradiated, genetically modified, or grown in sludge, which may contain heavy metals, dioxins, and/or other contaminants. There is no way to remove these inorganic and potentially dangerous materials.  I also want any food labeled "organic" to say clearly somewhere on the label whether it has had a "veggie wash" containing iodine. These "veggie washes" are used when items are shipped long distances. High iodine intake has thyroid cancer implications.  To not exclude genetically engineered, irradiated, "veggie washed" and sludge-grown food products from the definition of what the USDA considers organic, you will defeat the very consumer expectations that created the organic foods industry in the first place. If these methods are included in the USDA's standards, the USDA will then have effectively destroyed any faith one might have in an organic seal.
