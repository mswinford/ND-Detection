comment = I feel that genetically engineered organisms, including seeds used in organic crop production, should not be included in the National Organic Standards in any form. All genetically engineered organisms and products including ingredients that contain genetically engineered materials should be labeled as such. I support organic standards that allow me to make conscious, educated decisions on the food that I eat. There have been no long term studies on genetically engineered foods and the influence that these foods have on the environments they are grown in or on the people that consume them. I have always bought organic food stuffs because of the certifying groups that assure me of the purity of the product. The organic foods arena should remain free of genetically engineered organisms. I do have been altered on the genetic level. Thank You.
