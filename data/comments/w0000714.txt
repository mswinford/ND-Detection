comment = Presently, we are certified in Va as an organic fruit grower and will continue to be cetified. But we also have honey bees and as there are no other field crops within several miles, we would like to have our honey certified as organic.   The present rules do not seem to allow us to use a miticide during the honey flow and the miticide is necessary for the survivsl of the bees! the Varoa mite is killing thousands of swarms of bees and is a new problem to beekeepers here in the USA.    Without Apistan or until the USDA can find a solution there may be no future for beekeeping in the USA.    Does the organic rules allow the use of synthetic chemicas under these conditions? PLEASE MAKE AN EXCEPTION FOR THE BEEKEEPERS UNTIL THIS PROBLEM IS RESOLVED!
