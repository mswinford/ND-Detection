comment = Dear Sir/Madam:  I would like you to know that I very strongly oppose the use of:  Sewer Sludge Irridation  Genetic Engineering  I truly belive that the long term effects of these methods can be deadly. I am a home organic gardener, and I buy many  products from the Health Food store because of my fears of Genetic Engineering especially. The use of Bovine Growth Hormone is another sore subject with me. The animals get infections after being on the drugs and that infection is what goes into the milk.   I would be in great support of more community gardens that supply organically grown food to neighbors, co-ops, and  neighborhood farmers markets. More and more I think people are becoming more educated about the effects of chemicals, pesticipes, and more supportive of organically grown agriculture.   Texas Organic laws are very strict, but I would even support produce grown and promoted as pesticide free and Naturally Growing methods used.  I will never support the use of SEWER SLUDGE, IRRIDIATION, & GENETIC ENGINEERING. It just frightens me.  Andrea Morgenstern amorgenstern@hchcda.co.harris.tx.us (713) 840-8122 x174 work
