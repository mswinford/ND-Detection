comment = I am a consumer of "organic" produce. Ideally, I'd like to purchase 100% of my food from "organic" sources. I am also a vegetarian mainly due to the inhumane treatment of animals in the meat and poultry industries. I would like to see the following substances prohibited for use; hormones, antibiotics, chemical insecticides and animal byproducts for feed. And I am against any food irradiation.The instances of excessive and polluting practices by many large producers shows me that smaller is definately better, when the production can be accomplished in the most natural and humane way.
