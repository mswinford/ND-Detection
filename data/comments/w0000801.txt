comment = I am a consumer of organic products. I use these products to avoid some of the many substances that these new rules will permit --irradiation, pesticides, antibiotics, and inorganic feeds and fertilizers. The effort to create national standards should not weaken the strong rules under which California organic farms must operate. Perhaps it would be better to have an interim category of foods to permit those agricultural producers who are transitioning to a stronger organic standard, rather than to weaken organic standards.   The weakening of standards in this regard will undermine consumer confidence and create a cynicism about a category of products that has a growing group of well of informed consumers.   I would like to encourage that the rules be amended to reflect a higher organic standard.
