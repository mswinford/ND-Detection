comment = Previously I had submitted comments asking that GENETICALLY ALTERED SUBSTANCES, including seed, be prohibited from use in foods labeled "organic". If these are NOT PROHIBITED in the final regs., I believe that, as a minimum, both for comsumer protection and choice, it should be a requirement that they BE SPECIFICALLY LABELED as having been used.
