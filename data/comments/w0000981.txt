comment = I am deeply disturbed to hear of the proposed corruption to the definition of ORGANIC PRODUCTS by the Department of Agriculture.  I would support national rules that were in alignment with the California Organic Foods Act of 1990.  As a taxpayer and ORGANIC FOODS CONSUMER I demand that the USDA follow recommendations of the National Organic Standards Board and the California Organic Program and stop caving to the pressure of the INDUSTRIAL AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY. America must be the world model for protecting our world resources and the health of our citizens by substituting ORGANIC AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES for the standard practices which poison our consumers, land, water and air.  thank you, Cheryl Ross
