comment = Strongly oppose uses of radiation and sewage 'fertilizer' for food production and preparation. We get enough toxic material in our foods and environment already w/o putting it in our food sources.   If 'organic' is to mean anything, these products must be excluded.  Recommend you stop trying to find uses for industrial and nuclear garbage in our food supplies.
