comment = * sewage sludge leaves in the soil to xic metals and othe poisonous substances * irradiation is a killer * bio-engineered produce is not organic, it's man-made  why would I pay extra for all that garbage? I won't. I can always get my produce from the growers I know and trust at the farmers market  why are you people trying to cheat the public in order to please big businesses? the answer is obvious.
