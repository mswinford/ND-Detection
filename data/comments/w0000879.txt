comment = As a California resident I have long enjoyed knowing that the food that I buy that is certified as organic is truly organic due to the certification process for organic foods in California. I buy organic food whenever I can not only because of heath concerns but because I know I am supporting an aggricultural process that is not furhter damaging the environment. I applaud the effort to create a nationwide certification process for organic foods, however, I am deeply concerned that this may include food that has been irradiated. If irradiation is allowed to be considered an acceptable practice for handling food that is labeled as organic, the organic food industry will participate in a environmentally non-sustainable practice that will have highly negative effects on the envirnment. The production and waste associated with the nuclear material necessary to conduct irratiation is completely inconsistent with my goal as a consumer of buying organic as a way to support environmentally sustainable aggriculture and food handling processes.
