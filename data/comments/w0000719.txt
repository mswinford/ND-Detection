comment = I am all for new national organic standards in the United States. I feel that it is good for the environment, good for the health of the citizens of this country and for all who take advantage of our organic crops. I fully support national standards for the definition of "organic". And I would like to congratulate the USDA on a job well done in recognizing the strong organic market.  I would like to see that livestock should only be labeled as organic if they have NEVER been treated with anitbiotics of any form, the use of any growth hormones or any other un-natural substances in order to be labeled as organic. I believe that allowing them to be labeled as organic as long as they meet conditions within x number of months is not sufficient to be labeled as organic. The living conditions of the animals should be free of confinement, allowed to roam freely in the outdoors, and should be allowed to live naturally. For the most part I agree with the livestock section of the new standards.  Thank you for your time and for allowing the public to comment on these new national standards. Keep up the good work!
