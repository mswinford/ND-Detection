comment = I propose that certifiction be free and done by Extension Agents. They would then be required to learn about altenatives agriculture and become a conduit for our organic problems back to the Land Grant research universities. This would also give these universities a vested interest (at last) in the success of organic, sustainable agriculture.    Irradiation should not be allowed on food labeled organic.
