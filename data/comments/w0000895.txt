comment = To Whom it May Concern,  I am seriously concerned with the proposed use of either irradiated or genetically engineered foods as "organic," also with the proposed use of sewage sludge as an organic fertilizer. The process of making sewage sludge concentrates the heavy metals and other toxins thrown down the drain. As an organic gardener and an organic product consumer, I feel that these should be proscribed from the proposed rule.
