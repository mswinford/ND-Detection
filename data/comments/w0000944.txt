comment = I and my family consume organic produce and we grow California Certified Organic Farmers-certifies gravenstein apples.  I heard an excellent program about the proposed rule and the process on NPR radio.  I feel strongly that the US consumer has the right to choose. But choice must be informed, and when one goes out of the way, or pays a bit extra for organic produce, that consumer must know that organic means something with the highest standards. On certain items, we want our 7 year old child to eat fruits and vegetables grown in healthy soil, which have no residues, which contribute to a viable and sustainable clean agricultural economy. which is not irradiated to overcome the consequences of poor growing and handling practices, which utilize TIME TESTED and accepted agricultural methodologies, which never utilize industrial waste with heavy metals and other unsafe pollutants as growing media. Only 2% of all US consumed food is organic. If our new standards are less than the most conservative for health and long-term sustainability, consumers will have no real choice, a market niche will be lost, family and organic farms will wither away, and I think the health of the US public will suffer. I and amny people I know expect you to follow the lead of the highest standards developed by the private-sector organic growers certification bodies such as the CCOF in California, NOT the agribusiness giants which already control a vast share of market share of the US food supply!!  Thank you for listening. Bob Jordan/Cloverdale California
