comment = It is clear to any of us who follow the organic certification debate that the ONLY REASON relaxed standards are now being proposed is because the rapidly GROWING MARKET for organic food means that the BIG BOYS (i.e. factory farmers like Ralston-Purina, General Mills, et al) want to be able to SAY they are organic without actually BEING so.   Does anyone really wonder why the current stringent criteria (especially in California) seem to be less of a problem for small, independent, often worker-owned farms than they are for publicly traded corporations that have to worry about the look and feel of their annual reports? There are two different types of farmers: those who care about the land and the food they grow in it/eat from it, and then there are factory farmers, whose sole purpose in life is to produce as much bad iceberg lettuce per acre as is theoretically possible.  SHAME ON YOU, USDA, for even considering this thinly veiled attempt to wrest organic certification from the hands of real farmers and put it in the hands of people with an agenda. Are you on our side? Have you ever been? You won't be laughing when your hairless, diabetic, web-toed grandchildren trundle meekly over the face of this poisoned planet some day. Or maybe you will. Maybe you'll be laughing because your generation's bottom line was fatter for a few years.   Or maybe it won't matter any more because we'll all just be dead.
