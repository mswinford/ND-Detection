comment = Dear Sir or Madam:  I am writing in regard to the proposed changes to the laws on Organic produce. I'd like to ask that you not allow genetic altering to be done to organic produce. To me, "organic" means "all-natural," the way God intended it. I really worry about the health ramifications of the genetic altering of foods. I realize that there must be some sort of testing done on the foods for them to be deemed "safe," however, do we know the long term effects? What about "absorbability of nutrients in genetically altered foods?? I pay a premium on organic foods for health reasons. I have severe allergies, both to foods and pollen. I also have chemical sensitivites which were probably brought on by the fact that I live in a brand new home, and live in an agricultural area (so I get to breathe in pesticides on the days I forget to close my windows when I hear the pesticide plane going by. I have noticed that there have been foods which I had been unable to tolerate when I purchased them off the shelf, but that I've had luck with in their organic form. For instance, eating regular grapes gives me stomache and intestinal cramps, as well as chest pains. However, when I eat organic grapes, I don't even have a slight reaction.  I truly hope that you will read unbiased studies before making this decision. I'm not asking to ban genetically altered food outright, I'm just asking that genetically altered foods not be allowed to wear the "organic" label. To do so would bastardize the "organic" label. Thank you! Marcia Queen Gilroy, CA marcia21@ix.netcom.com
