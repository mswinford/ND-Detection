comment =  We represent several thousand people who are using natural and alternative means for healing and health maintenance. Key to us is the use of organic, vegetarian food. We strongly object to any genetically-engineered food being labeled as "organic" until its long-term consequences to our health can be determined. We also strongly object to any genetically-engineered vegetable having animal genes woven into it. We request that any such vegetables be clearly labeled as "engineered with animal genes," or something akin, which will help the consumer identify a strictly vegetarian item from an engineered "vegetable."
