comment = Section 205.23 should prohibit municipal sewer sludge or biosolids containing any heavy metals, chemical solvents, or any other synthetic substances suspected to have adverse health effects, i.e. the sludge is purely animal digestive waste matter. Burden of proof that the sludge does not contain such substances falls upon the farmers or business desiring to use the sludge and must be proven before the produce can be labeled organic. Such sludge use must include erosion controls to avoid disease outbreaks like the Pfisteria outbreaks in Maryland and North Carolina.  Section 205.25 should prohibit feeding back diseased and waste animal body parts, offal, and blood to farm animals. This practice raises serious bacterial infection problems, contributing to problems like mad cow disease.
