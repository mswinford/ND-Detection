comment = I want to suggest that the proposals regarding inclusion of processes generally considered anathema by the existing organic foods and farming industries, e.g. genetically engineered foods, irradiated foods, intensive confinement of farm animals, rendered animal parts in feed, and the use of toxic sewage sludge spread over farmlands and pastures, open the door for large agribusiness companies, processors, and supermarket chains to enter and dominate the organic food market, and preempt natural food consumers, independent retailers, and farmers involvement in future rules regarding organic food.  I am opposed to this not so much out of sympathy toward the latter or even antipathy toward the former, but because I think close regulation of the food chain is a "wave of the future" that might well bring much more than unadulterated foods to choosy consumers. If we recognize that industrialization and commercialization of food and drug production can be taken too far, it is easy to see that the advantages of "organic" farming and production methods extend beyond their product to old-fashioned values that can benefit society as a whole.   There is much evidence that the globalization of the food market carries with it fantastic hazards, and there is no basis for confidence that big business will be able to prevent recurring outbreaks of food poisoning, etc. as long as this "inevitable" process continues unabated. Let the organic foods industry be regulated more or less according to its own strict lights, and resist the temptation to dilute this new and positive trade with shortsighted common denominators.   Mass-merchandising, mass-distribution, and mass-production are not essential to this business, and the federal government should not by its own reasoning try to force a change of this magnitude.
