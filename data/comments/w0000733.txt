comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them. I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so i can choose not to consume them.
