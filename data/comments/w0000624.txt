comment = I entreat the Department, in establishing national Organic standards, to err on the side of conservatism, caution, and regard for the hard work of all of the individual certifying bodies currently protecting the meaning of the word "organic".  As a consumer, I rely on the "Certified Organic" designation to assure myself that what I am consuming was produced free of contaminants, chemicals, additives, genetic engineering, or irradiation. I know that by choosing products with this label that I am making a conscious choice to support an agriculture qualitatively different from that used to produce most of our food today.  "Organic" is not a matter of technicalities; it is a philosophical orientation necessarily expressed in terms of rules and regulations. This being the case, it is vitally important that the USDA go out of its way to uphold and preserve the spirit of that orientation in establishing organic standards.   A conservative standard, one that the consumer can rely on for protection from dubious or dangerous or unproven elements, earns respect both nationally and internationally. A compromised standard, one that yields to pressures from commercial interests and waters down the meaning of "organic" so as to include precisely the elements the organic consumer is trying to avoid, renders certification meaningless and vacates trust in the USDA as a guardian of the people's wellbeing.  There will always be arguments about implementation details. But clear support of the term "organic" as a vision and a worldview and not just a set of regs to manipulate will reflect credit on the USDA and engender long-term confidence in the standard itself.
