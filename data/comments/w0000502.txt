comment = Genetically engineered crops, livestock, seeds, and other foods should not be designated as "organic" and should be labeled for what they are: largely untested, and therefore unknown and potentially dangerous. I do not want my family to be guinea pigs for chemical corporations such as Monsanto. Also, disallowing states their right to protect their citizens by prohibiting further labeling beyond what the USDA will require is wrong. I can only assume that the reasoning behind *not* labeling genetically engineered foods is that most people wouldn't buy them if they were given a choice. Specifically removing the consumer's choice goes against everything that the USDA should stand for - providing consumers with knowledge and some semblance of assurance that what they're buying is safe. In the case of genetically engineered foods, the USDA cannot make this assurance, which means that the consumer should be left with the decision of whether to participate in this experiment. It may be eventually discovered that these products are, in fact, safe and beneficial. Perhaps the chemical companies believe this to be the case now, but the public has not been convinced. It should be the role of the chemical companies to educate consumers about their products so that we can make informed choices. Government agencies such as the USDA are in place to help in this education, and to protect consumers. They are not established to force feed untested and controversial products to unwitting and naive consumers.
