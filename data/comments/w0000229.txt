comment = Dear Ms. Stommes,  As a family that has sought primarily organic foods for several years, we are naturally interested in the proposed standards for certification of these products. The recent USA Today article prompted me to write this letter addressing two aspects of this situation.  Firstly, we are gravely concerned about the proposed allowance of irradiation, genetic engineering and especially sewage sludge fertilization in the production of foods to be marketed as organic. A major and legitimate concern among many health-conscious individuals is the pesticide content in the food and water generally available in this country. Absent some provision which I am unable to discern in the current proposed standards, they would virtually eliminate our ability to buy foods with any degree of confidence that we have avoided these toxins.  Secondly, we strongly encourage the inclusion of stronger and more specific standards for the humane treatment of animals. The reasons for this are so obvious and numerous they need not be delineated here.  Frankly, I hold out little hope of individual opinions like ours having any impact when weighed against the well-funded and full-time representation of the big mega-farms and other industry giants who focus first, last and always on profit. Nonetheless, we would like to know what organizations might exist for the purpose of bringing like-minded people together on a galvanized front. I also wonder if there has been any consideration given to including a separate category of truly “natural” foods that would meet more stringent criteria with regard to practices like the irradiation, gentetic engineering and sewage sludge fertilization.  Thank you for your time and interest. And Happy Holidays.  Regards,  Royce Herndon
