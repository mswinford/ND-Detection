comment = 	It is extremely important that the USDA define "organic" food as being produced without genetic engineering and processed without irriadtion. Both of these technologies have unknown effects on food and health and go against the spirit of natural farming. I realize that the USDA has intentionally left these issues off of the current proposal. However, in the interest of national and environmental health, I ask in advance that only natural organic food be labeled as such. Thank you.
