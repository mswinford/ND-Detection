comment = I am all for new national organic standards in the United States. I feel that it is good for the environment, good for the health of the citizens of this country and for all who take advantage of our organic crops. I fully support national standards for the definition of "organic". And I would like to congratulate the USDA on a job well done in recognizing the strong organic market.  I would like to see the labeling of all products, especially in the cases where the product contains genetically engineered substances, the us of the irradiation process, the use of drugs to treat livestock (including growth hormones,) the use of chemicals on crops such as insecticides and herbicides. I do not support the use of genetically engineered substances in the organic market at all. I beleive that genetic engineering is not necessary, wields no advantages to the health of citizens and in the long run will cause irreversable damage to the environment and to the health of people. If genetic engineering were to be included in the new standards I would like to see them labeled as being genetically engineered or not. I also do not support the use of irradiation of any foods. Again, it serves no advantage to the environment or to the health of the people, it is simply not necessary. I would like to see all products labeled accordingly if irradiation is used.  Thank you for your time and for allowing the public to comment on these new national standards. Keep up the good work!
