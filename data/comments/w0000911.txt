comment = As an organic practitioner, educator and writer I am totally against any irradiation of products, use of sludge on land, or use of genetically engineered crops. Until more is known about the long term affects of such applications they should be PROHIBITED UNDER ORGANIC GUIDELINES. Thank you for your time, consideration and energy. judi segebarth
