comment = I strongly feel for organic crops that land fertilized with sewage sludge is wrong. It goes against everything organic farming stands for to take human waste with everything else that is flushed down the drain and put it on the soil. If this action is allowed, many consumers will always wonder in back of their minds if their certified organic product is truely safe.  Regarding genetically engineered foods, as a comsumer, I am concerned also that this is too new for organic farming. This should be considered for use after perhaps twenty years of study.
