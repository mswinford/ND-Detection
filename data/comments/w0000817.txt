comment = This comment concerns the use of genetically engineered organisms either for seed or for beneficial use in crop management.  I think the use of genetically engineered organisms (GEO) should be specifically disallowed by the NOP rule, until on a case by case basis long term study (i.e. 10-15 years) of each organism shows their production and use to be benign or beneficial.  My reasoning is more philosophical than based on empirical study, but I think it is reasonable nonetheless.  I believe one of the primary reasons people choose organic over conventional foods because they have a healthy skepticism about many of the newer production methods and uses of synthetic materials in production management. While short term studies of many of these methods and synthetic materials may show them to be benign, what myself and others are concerned with are the long term effects which can take as long as a human lifetime to discern the accumulative effects of.  In the case genetic engineered organisms, I would agree that organisms do change over time due to naturally occuring factors, regardless of genetic engineering. However, my concern with GEO is that this change is sped up to the point where any long term study (say 10-15 years) is incompatible with the rate of introduction of newly engineered organisms.  What problem is there with conventional foods containing these newly engineered foods, while organic food disallows their use?   While the vast majority of these GEO will be proven safe by long term use, there some probably will not. That these potential unsafe GEO are NOT in the food or used in the production of the food is exactly part of what I believe the organic label should imply, i.e. lower health risk due to the fact that no methods or substances which have no long term history are allowed.  Thank you for your efforts, Jeff
