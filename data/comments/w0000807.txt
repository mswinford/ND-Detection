comment = Just a general concern. As a member of the "baby boomer" generation, I was brought up to believe in the common use of antibiotics. Due to the increasing virulence of many common disease-causing bacteria I have changed this belief. Over the long term, the widespread use of antibiotics has made certain diseases (e.g. tuberculosis) more difficult to cure.  I am concerned that the widespread use of antibiotics as pesticides in agricultural products will produce a similar problem; namely, that pests will develop resistance to the antibiotic agents and eventually become more difficult to eradicate.  Therefore, I believe that allowing antibiotics in the production of organic produce or livestock is ill-advised. I urge you to remove antibiotics from the category of allowed substances for this proposed rule.  I regularly buy and consume organic produce. It is my understanding that most organic farmers do NOT use antibiotics. I would actively seek out producers that do not use these substances if the USDA allowed the use of antibiotics in products labeled "organic".  Thank you for your consideration, Steve Keller
