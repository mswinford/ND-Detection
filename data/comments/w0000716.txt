comment = I am all for new national organic standards in the United States. I feel that it is good for the environment, good for the health of the citizens of this country and for all who take advantage of our organic crops. I fully support national standards for the definition of "organic". And I would like to congratulate the USDA on a job well done in recognizing the strong organic market.  I would like to add, however, that I do NOT support the inclusion of GENETICALLY ENGINEERED substances as organic, I do NOT support the IRRADIATION of organic foods, and I do NOT support the use of SEWAGE SLUDGE on organic crops. I do not wish to see genetically engineered substances included due to the unpredictable nature of genetic engineering and the possible negative side effects caused by introducing genetically engineered substances into the environment. In general I would like to see the LABELING of foods which do contain genetically engineered substances as the consumers have a right to know the contents of the foods that we eat. I would also like to see the irradiation of foods NOT included in the new national organic standards. Irradiation reduces the nutritional value of the foods that many people are looking for in natural organic foods and it introduces the possibility of carcinogenic materials being introduced into the foods. I would also NOT like to see the use of sewage sludge on organic crops due to the possible contents of the sewage sludge, such as radioactive materials and other toxic chemicals. I refer you to a case in the greater Denver area where the city was to allow for radioactive sewage sludge to be dumped on nearby crops.  Thank you for your time and for allowing the public to comment on these new national standards. Keep up the good work!
