comment = I do not want genetically engineered food on the market in any form until it is tested with the best scientific methods available in long term studies. I don’t want genetically engineered seeds to be considered organic because their not. I specifically want any vegetable or fruit or nut or grain or fiber crop that is altered in any way to be labeled.
