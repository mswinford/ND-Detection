comment = I am disturbed to learn that the USDA is considering the adoption of NOP rules that would expand the definition of "organic" to include such dubious items as genetically altered species, irradiated foods and crops grown atop toxic sewage sludge.  Just who's running the show there? Agribusiness interests? I suspect so, and I am not surprised, but I am outraged at this turn of events.  It seems to me that the definition of "organic," if a government is truly interested in creating and defending one, should be unequivocal. The concept of organic farming, after all, is not new: it is a return to something we left behind in our misguided haste to demonstrate our newfound chemical influence over the natural world. We have been learning of--and often regretting--the consequences of our often horribly destructive chemical tinkering with the environment ever since the advent of the chemical revolution, around the end of World War II.  In identifying "organic" farming practices and products, we should create an unimpeachable standard of purity--a standard by which we can measure our successes, preserve the quality of our food, and maintain integrity as stewards of the land and its bounty. To do anything less would render meaningless the use of the word "organic" and would take us one step further on the road to ecological ruin.  I urge the USDA to eliminate such equivocations from the wording of the NOP and to stand firm in defense of truly organic practices.  Thanks for reading.
