comment = As a regular consumer of organic produce, I am dismayed that the USDA will allow the following to be labelled organic: - genetically engineered produce - irradiated foods - produce grown on land fertilized with toxic sewage sludge - food animals raised under conditions of high antibiotic use and   and other hazardous chemicals (eg. insecticides sprayed on their feed)  Please adopt instead a standard for "organic" that is as stringent as California's own definition.
