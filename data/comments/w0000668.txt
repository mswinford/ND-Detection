comment = Okay, I'm back again.  5 days and milk is organic. That's ridiculous. You are indeed trying to give agribusiness access to the  chic in the word organic, which is real value  created by real loving people   and it will not succeed.  Also, it is absolutely reprehensible that there be no allowance for labeling to the  effect that company's products exceeds the national Organic Standards  Change this or face mass organized resistance and ultimate failure
