comment = I enjoy eating organic dairy products. I feel very strongly that dairy products labeled as organic should come from cows that are organic - NO antibiotics, NO growth hormones, and NO non-organic feed. Labeling requirements should be very strict so that the consumer can make informed choices. thank you
