comment = I am just curious as to why the companies manufacturing Organic fertilizers  are required by the law to mention on the container or the box that "this product is NOT a fertilizers but just a supplement, and should be used along with a fertilizer"??  My company distributes VEGES Organic fertilizers and laboratory as well as field tests have proven that our products are much more powerful than any chemical fertilizer in the market right now.   I think that its really unjust that organic agriculture and gardening is being punished this way. If you really want the consumers to be practice orgaic gardening than please end this ridiculous law or frankly stop cheating consumers by on one hand asking them to be more organic and environmentally friendly and on the other forcing them to buy chemical fertilizers.
