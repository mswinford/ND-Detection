comment = The rules in general are okay, but the three areas which have not yet been decided need some comment. Most importantly, I believe that the genetically engineered organisms must not be allowed in the organic foods category. Organic implies natural, and it cannot be certified that such genetically altered foods are natural -- in fact, I believe they violate the laws of nature and are deadly to mankind if eaten over the long term.
