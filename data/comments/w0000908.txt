comment = I have heard that the use of fertilizer produced from sewage might be allowed. I understand that such fetilizer is the result of the consumption of sewage by bacteria and that the fertilizer product is sterilized bacteria. If this is true and the heavy metals have effectively been removed, and if there no chemical treatment after the bacteria have been sterilized, then I support the inclusion of such fetilizer as an organic component.  Whether bacteria come from cow patties, chicken manure, or sewage treatment plants is not relevant.
