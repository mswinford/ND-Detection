comment = I am outraged as a consumer that irradiated foods, gentically engineered foods, and foods grown on lands fertilized with sewage sludge are included in the USDA's proposed rules for organic foods. These practices have never been a part of organic food agriculture. Inclusion of these types of foods is irresponsible. I hope this rule serves one purpose--to convince people to grow their own healthy organic foods and not be victimized by federal macromanagement strategies  that pander to large-scale agribusinesses. This rule is indicative of how mainstream  macromanagement policies continue to corrupt what is a God given right for all who inhabit  Earth--access to healthy foods. I enjoy the fruits of a 38 acre burgeoning farm in the Blue Ridge mountains of Virginia, but for those who depend on responsible agricultural practices to provide their families with healthy foods, all I can say is "God help you because the  government will not."
