comment = Following SHOULD NOT be allowed for "organic" foods:  Genetic engineering  Irradiation Sewage sludge as fertilizer  Labeling should be specific and if any of the above are allowed it should  be noted on the labels. I would want to know about any pesticides or  commercial fertilizer used in growing food as well as the things I have noted above.  I was hoping this site would include the USDA proposal for organic food so  I could comment more directly on the items under consideration.
