comment = As an exporter and broker, it has become obvious that the role inspectors play in certification has numerous ethical implications. You do have a statement regarding conflict of interest, however, I do not think it is strong enough.The statement below (taken out of context) does not sufficiently cover the problems inherent in qualifying and hiring inspectors. There is also no statement in the rule that I have found (yet?) that clearly states that conflict of interest would ban an individual from being an inspector. I voluntarily removed myself from reviewing inspections when I began to broker organic products. I certainly do not want my operation inspected by another broker nor do I want one of my producers' operations inspected by a broker who knows that another broker is selling the producers goods into a competing market. I do not think that farmers acting as inspectors are equally questionable. The nature of brokerage leaves too many holes. Can this be more thouroughly addressed?  (2) For each person identified in § 205.304(a)(2), the identification of any food and agriculture-related business interests, including business interests of immediate family members, that may cause a conflict of interest.
