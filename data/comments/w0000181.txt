comment = REQUIRE LABELING OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED COMPONENTS OF FOOD AND SUPPLEMENTS DESTINED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION!!  Please note that I am strongly supportive of the mandatory requirement that any food or food component that is genetically engineered be labeled as such. This includes seeds sold to farmers, drugs used in medicines, health food supplements, any food items sold in grocery stores or other food stores, packaged foods, fresh foods (label on the container or sticker on the individual item).  I have noticed that my sleep at night is significantly disturbed by the effect of these genetically engineered food items. There may also be a correlation to mood swings and these foods in my daily experiences.  Finally, I must comment that I have made some effort to educate myself on the process used by scientists to manipulate the DNA material, and the fact is, they do not have a clue as to what they are actually doing. They just fire the genome into DNA strand. Like throwing a rock into the window of a house - no one knows what damage is done inside. Also, on a more philosophical level, nature is far more intelligent and life supporting than mankind seems to admit to itself. These DNA molecules hold millions of years of experience. Horticultural breeding allows Nature to be the final judge on what is acceptable. Stick to this process.  At least, allow educated consumers like myself to choose to be more healthy, by requiring the labeling of these genetically engineered substances. Monsanto is not driven by the highest ideals of mankind!  Sincerely, Peter Lyda
