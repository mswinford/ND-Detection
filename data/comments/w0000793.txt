comment = As a consumer, I would like to see strict regulations for the use of the term organic on foods. Bioengineered foods, sewage sludge and irradiation are not acceptable options for organic foods. This is what the consumers want. This is what the organic growers want. This should be what the USDA wants. Don't let us down.
