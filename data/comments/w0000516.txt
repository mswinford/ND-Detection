comment = Dear Sir/Madam; Please do not permit the inclusion of any of the definitions or guidelines for organic food production, processing and distribution of any genetically modified materials. As there is no research to quantify the long term possible effects on humans, agriculture or the environment of these transgenics and/or the associated antibiotic markers or virus vectors, prudent management suggests a no regrets policy is the best course.  Further I would very much appreciate a requirement to label all transgenics so that I have the choice whether or not to consume same.  Sincerely,  David Gerry.
