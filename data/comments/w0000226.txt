comment = I have read several parts of the proposedregulations and have two comments:   1. in section 205.22 (active synthetic substances allowed ) - - - I believe TOXINS FROM GENETICALLY ENGINEERED BACTERIA should not be allowed   whenthere appear to be a number of substances that are evidently considered non-toxic that can be used.    2. in section 205.8 ( didn't copy the title but it had to do with seed and plant material selection/resources ) - - - I believe the use of genetically altered seed   should be prohibited
