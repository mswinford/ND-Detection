comment =  I ask that you not allow genetically engineered seeds or produce to  be used in organic production. Why bother even having an organic  designation if you do this? Genetically _engineered foods_ are just that:  _engineered foods_, and are in no sense organic. They also have not been  tested for their long-term effects on human health, animal health, or the  environment, and I personally have not and will not consume them. In fact,  I want all genetically engineered foods to be labelled so that I  don't have to waste my time determining which foods are and are not.
