comment = I do not consider genetically engineered foods to be organic and I urge the USDA to require genetically-engineered and erradiated foods to be so labelled. Organic, both by definition as it pertains to the natural growth of a plant, or by intent as it pertains to the producers and consumers of organic foods, does not include food that has been genetically-engineered or artificially altered.  Thank you.
