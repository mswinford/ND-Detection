comment = I am for National guidelines on what products are marketed as "organic."  Thank you for requesting feedback from consumers on a Federal standard for the term "organic" before the new standard is decided.  I am a firm believer and consumer of organic products. To include the use of fertilizer made from treated sewage and the practice of irradiation are contra to the spirit of organics. I don't worship at the altar of almighty science, so I don't care if scientists tell me that these two practices are harmless. We have no way of knowing all of the ramifications and side effects when products are consumed that have been exposed to these two methods. With all the drugs, chemicals, and waves that many people are exposed to, it doesn't make sense to gamble that treated sludge and irradiation are harmless. Since neither sludge nor irradiation are necessary - if one is not to be driven by fears - then they should be omitted from the standard of "organic."  As a consumer, I have the right to know what goes into the processing of the food that I buy. I read labels and educate myself on choices of what I put in my body. I want to buy food from manufacturers who care as much as I do about creating good health. Many people - from farmers to natural food manufacturers - have put much time, energy, and money into developing healthful products that will sustain both me and the Earth. I am aghast at the audacious thinking that treated sludge and irradiation are health supporting. Not if one understands the true nature of the energy of food.  I implore those who are to decide on the Federal standards of the use of "organic" to exclude foods that have been exposed to treated sewer waste and irradiation.
