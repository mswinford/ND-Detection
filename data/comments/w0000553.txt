comment =  I have been buying exclusively organic produce and dairy for many years because I want my family's food to be free of pesticides, synthetic fertilizers and antibiotics. I oppose the USDA's attempt to weaken organic certification to include irradiation or the use of sewage sludge which may introduce heavy metals and other synthetic substances.   California (and other) organic farmers have proven it is possible to produce the highest quality organic products at a profit. Leave this market alone. Consumers are already voting with their dollars. Those who don't care about organics have plenty of choice at Safeway and Lucky's. In fact, Raley's (in northern California) has a program of monitoring their produce, which provides a sort of middle ground between organic and "anything goes" agriculture. If large agribusiness can't produce truly organic products at a profit, then let them stay out of that market!   Don't water down the organic certification at the expense of the consumer who desires a quality product and is willing to pay for it!
