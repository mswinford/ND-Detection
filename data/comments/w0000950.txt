comment = -Human waste should be allowed in organic agriculture if it is composted in a manner that renders it safe from human pathogens and applied to avoid excessive nitrate leaching. Heavy metals and toxic detergents that are typically found in sewage systems should not be applied to agricultural land, particularly certified organic land. As a result most of the so called biosolids currently rendered by our sewage systems should not be permitted in organic agriculture. My understanding is that unless toxic materials are kept out of the human waste stream from the beginning it is virtually impossible to produce a finished biosolid product that is free of toxic components. Until our society commits itself to separating our human waste from our toxic waste at the source, a truly sustainable recycling of nutrients will not be possible in agriculture. At this time biosolids should be prohibited from use on certified organic (and other) land.
