comment = 205.8 should be changed to make it clear that genetically altered seeds are NOT to be used. Does the USDA really believe they can allow genetically altered crops into our organic food supply, and still be taken seriously? Organic farming keeps open-pollinated foods alive, preserving their unique and natural genetic heritage. If genetically altered foods are allowed, it will destroy this link with the foods which have supported humanity, since the beginning of time. Really folks, get serious. The chemical companies already own commercial agriculture. They don't need us and we don't want them!
