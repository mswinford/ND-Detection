comment = I am an earth scientist, and am currently finishing up my dissertation that is in large part on chemical-sedimentologic processes, thus I consider myself to have a solid background in several issues at stake here. I am also a consumer concerned with my health, and the sustenance of our soils. I am very pleased to know that the USDA is responding to the public's desire for a strict definition for organic labelling. I trust no corporations claims unless they are regulated, and even then suspiciously.  I feel that at least three items have been wrongly omitted from the proposal. These are: 1. the allowance of genetically engineered crops and livestock 2. the allowance of irradiation and 3. the allowance of potentially chemical- and heavy metal-laden sewage sludge as fertilizer (at least not until standards are in place to clean up potentially hazardous substances within it).  In some respects, the issue of how potentially harmful these three may be is irrelevant (although I go on the record as believing they are). What IS relevant is that those of us concerned enough to pay the added cost for organic foods are as concerned with the above three issues as the others, thus to leave them out would render the label practically useless to me, and I would continue to rely on California (or other) certifications. Please make this proposal complete and useful by correcting this oversight.  Diane K. McDaniel
