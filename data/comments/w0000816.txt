comment = I believe that allowing states to add regulations to this Rule is a mistake. Unless Congress requires you to allow this, I believe you should not do it.  Consider the regulations about clean air and cars. Manufacturers must make special cars to sell in California. It seems that if states could start regulating foods, there will be a real beaurocratic mess.  I believe that we should have a single national standard for Organic foods, and leave it at that. Keep the states out of it.
