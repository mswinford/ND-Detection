comment = I hope the proposed regulations allow the use of bio-engineered crops. It is no more logical to ban all bio-engineer crops than it would to ban any plant that has been domesticated. Furthermore, such a ban is hardly consistent with the current organic practices which use many standard agricultural practices. I doubt if any organic farms have yet returned to pre-agriculture hunter-gather practices.   The label "organic" should not be a representation of the irrational fears of a small minority.
