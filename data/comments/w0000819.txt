comment = I was shocked. I have been purchasing organic foods expressly to avoid synthetic ingredients, additives, fertilizers, etc, etc.  Your proposed rules will essentially remove the difference between organic and non-organic foods, thus rendering the term meaningless.  Are you doing this to appease major corporations who wish to be able to label their food products as organic? It sure sounds like it.  best wishes,  steve shapiro oregon
