comment = The organic federal standards are severely flawed. The consumer is looking toward organic products for health and environmental reasons. Allowing the use of sewer sludge, genetically engineered seeds, plants, and organisms, and the use of irradiation techniques casts a shadow on the purity of products to be labelled as organic. There is no place for these types of practices in organic production. By the very nature of being 'organic' means, to the majority of aware consumer, that the products are free from residues, systemic toxins, and free radicals (released during the irradiation process).   I implore the review committee to listen to the voices of the people, the consumer, and restore integrity and purity back in to the spirit of organic practices.
