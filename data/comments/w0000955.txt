comment = Dear USDA  We are an organic importing/ retailing/processing association located in the west of England. We view several of your proposed organic 'standards' with alarm. Namely, the use of Genetically Modified organisms in organic systems, the practice of intensive organic animal husbandry on holdings registerd as organic and, perhaps most importantly THE PROHIBITION OF PRIVATE ORGANIC LABELLING SCHEMES WHIC HAVE A HIGHER ORGANIC STANDARD THAN THAT OF THE USDA NATIONAL. In general we believe that kew elements of your poropsals veer so far from what we regard as organic methods as to no longer be organic by any sensible definition of the term. We must inform you, that should your prososals become law in their present form then OUR MEMBERS WILL ACTIVELY SEEK TO AVOID ALL AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE COMMING FROM THE UNITED STATES WHICH IS LABLELLED AS 'ORGANIC' AND WILL SEEK TO BUY FROM MARKETS ELESWHERE. We feel obliged to point out to you that as these proposals, and their true impact uopn genuinely orgnaic standards beocmes more widlely known amongst the organic community here in the UK and in Europe as a whole, (which is currently taking place) then our statement is likely to hold true for the european organic movement in general with regards to the non-purchasing of US 'organic'agricultural product. In adition we have heard that ministers and government institutions in europe are actively being lobbied to ensure that such the standards do not become watered down to the porposed US level. Should you be so foolhardy as to turn them into US law.
