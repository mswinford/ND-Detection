comment = I am pleased that the federal government has begun to address the important issue of regulating the use of the word "organic". I have been eating organic produce for over a decade, and I feel qualified to comment on this issue.  Please use common sense. If I buy something labeled "organic" I expect that it: * has not been irradiated * has not been fertilized with industrial sludge * has not been genetically altered * does not contain antibiotics None of these seem to be addressed in the proposed rules.
