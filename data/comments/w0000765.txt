comment = The following are topics and explanations:  Genetic Engineered Foods -- The inclusion of genetically engineered food, seeds, or products is completely innappropriate.   Factory Farming--Using inhumane, intensive confinement factory farm-style production methods on farm animals is completely innappropriate.  Toxic Sludge--Spreading toxic sewage sludge and industrial wastes, often disguised as fertilizer, on farm lands and pastures is completely innappropriate!  Animal Cannibalism--Feeding back diseased and waste animal body parts, organs, manure, and blood to farm animals and pets is not only gross and something concieved by minds far out of touch with eco-vitality, and also completely innapropriate.  Nuclear Irradiation--Using radioactive nuclear wastes to "kill bacteria" and prolong the shelf life of food products is stupid, dangerous and completely innappropriate.
