comment =  As a concerned consumer, I strongly urge the U.S.D.A. to prohibit the use of antibiotics and growth hormones from organic meat  and dairy products. By medicating animals with these toxic chemicals, you defeat the purpose of organic foods. The animals should only eat organic foods, again you lose the organic stamp by contaminating the food. I buy organic foods for the sake of my family's health and that of the planet. We create more problems when we use chemicals for agriculture and husbandry than we cure. After all these years, this is very apparent from the health of our soil down to our high rate of diseases, most notably cancer. Also, I strongly urge you to ban genetic engineering from organic foods. I also want any genetically engineered food to be labeled - this is imperative for consumer choice! I speak for many when I say that people want the choice of choosing organic or not and to know that organic is truly organic. Thank you.
