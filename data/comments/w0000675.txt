comment = Organic foods must not include genetically engineered seeds, crops, etc. As a consumer I have the right to choose what I eat. Personally I do not want to eat genetically engineered foods as I feel there are potential risks to consumers and the environment that must be studied over many years. Those who wish to NOT eat genetically engineered food must have a choice of foods which are guaranteed to be natural, i.e. organic. Therefore, genetically engineered foods should not be represented as organic. If the term "organic" were to include genetically engineered foods it would eliminate my freedom of choice and would force me to rely on growing my own food.
