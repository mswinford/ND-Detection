comment = I think that food irradiation is a good idea. I should help extend shelf life and make foods safer. Humans have been genetically engineering plants and animals for hundreds of years via breeding programs. I see nothing wrong with the new forms of genetic engineering. Therefore, I support the widespread use of genetically engineered foods, including in the organic food category. Finally, I am not opposed to animal confinement.
