comment = The absence of language regarding the specific prohibition of genetically modified organisms from organic production is abhorant. If in the future it can be shown and positively proven that a specific GMO will have no adverse affect on natural ecosystems then we could look at each modification on a case by case basis. Until we have comprehensive data that positively demonstrates that the genetic engineering lunacy that some misguided people are currently engaged in is in all ways beneficial to all natural ecosystems and constituent organisms on this planet then we cannot and should not "fool with mother nature".
