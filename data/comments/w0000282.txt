comment =  Hello,   While traveling I recently read an article in USA Today addressing rullings to include irradiated, genetically engineered foods and also foods grown on land fertilized with sewage sludge as "organic". I take issue with this consideration!   I have been growing and buying organic foods for most of my adult life. I've always managed to have a garden wherever I live and make it my business to fine a source of orcanically grown food to suppliment my gardening in the winter etc. There are multiple reasons that make me resistant to these suggestions. Organic to me means grown without trhe use of "man-made chemicals" as fertilizers for enducing controlled crops or for pest control. In the simplest of taste tests the organic foods have a more vibrant flavor and smell. Being an organic gardener I feel like the food I eat which might have a blemish from some critter in the garden is a good sign. To me it means that the ground is alive and that the food is receiving the natural nutrients which will enhance the food value for my system ti injest.   The idea of using some reconstituted waste material with only-god-knows what has been introduced into it's chemistry scares me. I am not interested in eating some MacDonalds burgers eater's" flu infested bowel movement" fed salad...thank-you-very-much!!  Maybe I'm old fashioned but the jury is still out on genetically engineered foods and foods which have be irradiated. I like food naturally grown on healthy earth which is tastey and full of all the imperfections god intended.  I you want to make some changes, make it necessary for any food grower to cut back on chemicals used in food growing and be more driven to spread fewer chemicals on our earth.  Thanks,  Franklin Eventoff
