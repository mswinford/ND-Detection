comment = I am steadfastly against labeling "organic" anything which has been bioengineered, irradiated or grown in sewer sludge. The USDA's reluctance to initially include such blindingly obvious "non-organic" processes as prohibited, simply shows the degree to which they are controlled by agribusiness concerns and the degree to which any USDA labelling should be disregarded completely.
