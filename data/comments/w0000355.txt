comment = December 19, 1997  Dear people--   Please do not allow biotechnological tampering (esp. genetic engineering), irradiation, and the use of non-organic sludge in the production of organic foods. I am VEHEMENTLY opposed to this!! Go find something else to screw up-- take a vacation or retire early... the imposition of your mindless and misguided will is not appreciated by myself, my employees, or the community in which I live.  Sincerely,  Grant Frith President Theresa Green Corporation Fairfield, Iowa
