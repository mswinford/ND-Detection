comment = As a consumer, I find the proposed regulations very troubling. For the label "organic" to have any meaning to me, I need to  be assured that the livestock have received no hormones of any kind and their feed has been 100% organic. A compromise on either issue renders the label meaningless to me.   I fear the that if the proposed to regulations go in to effect large producers whose products will be labled organic but in my mind not be organic will crush the smaller producers who produce true organic goods. The result for me as a consumer whould be that I lose the ability to buy the goods I want.
