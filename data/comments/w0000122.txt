comment = In your box for comments there is not a spot that says "consumer". It wold seem that the ultimate goal is with the consumer of the product in mind.  My comment is simple:  If it is grown organic, (produce), then as consumer I would trust that this means no synthetic fertilizers, sprays etc, (including sulpher on the apples), an example is apple farmer that says he is "organic" and uses the sulpher spray on his apples. Why do you have to have all these regulations when the truth is that you plant it or raise it the natural way. When you check as a govt. agency to certify the "organic farmer" just look around you on the farm, you can tell by the equipment in his barn what he is doing. By making this so over regulated you are only creating more costs and govt control than is necessary . you are doing just what the big farmer wants you to do, making the cost of organic foods high. The truth is they should be cheaper because of the lower cost with no sprays and gas.  True the crop yeild is lower, in some cases.  Navel oranges from the valley are being picked before there time and gassed to make them look orange and put on the market right now. Why not wait until they reach their natural color?? and sugar level. What does this gas do to me when I eat this orange. You, as a govt. agency are allowing this to happen. What will happen to this grower when he can not sell his fruit as organic if you tell him he cannot gas his oranges and change the color on them to fool the public into thinking that they are ripe.  Reading the regualtions put forth that I have looked over are far to compicated and regulatory and "big brother like".  You are taking this to far. You have the dirt, you grow your crop in it without adding synthic materials to it, use chicken manure, cow manure for nutrient, or organic compost or all three, that is it.!! Simple!! Just do it. One paragraph could do it, not a 6" file.  Stan Dunn benzdlr@cruzio.com mercedes@mercedesmonterey.com
