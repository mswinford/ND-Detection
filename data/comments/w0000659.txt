comment = I live in California and have been consuming organic produce and livestock for the past few years because of health problems. It's very reasurring to know that I'm eating food that has been raised without pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Some of the USDA's proposed regulations are much weaker than California standards and I think this is crazy! We are not interested in "natural poisons" or "genetically engineered organisms". The whole point is to get away from this crap! People like myself are interested in organic food because of the healthier life it helps you lead...Please don't dilute and confuse this label "organic". Don't let big business influence your decisions just because they want to get a piece of the profits in the growing organic trend. Think of the sick children that depend on you to keep organic the highest standard possible. If anything make the standards even higher. Thanks.  Lee
