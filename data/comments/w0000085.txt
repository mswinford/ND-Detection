comment = state programs should have NOTHING to do with national programs, regarding  certified organic. provided that everything is clearly labeled whether it  is nationally certified, or state certified. these labels SHOULD co-exist  on shelves next to each other. only this can ensure that new ideas are given a 'testing ground' before  being argued into or out-of the national standards. without this 'testing ground' approach, the national standards are doomed to remain stagnent, and become obsolete. also, there will always be debate as to something furthering, or hindering the national standards. this would allow these decisions to be made where  they will be the most efective, regionally.
