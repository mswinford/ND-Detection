comment = sections 205.202, 205.422, 205.421,AMS Table 5 Small organic farms are defined as selling less than $5000 per year. Clearly, the figure should be higher. Is it seriously believed that a gross income of $10,000 (or even $25,000) can be anything but small in today's world? Regardless of the exact figure, the profit from a small farm is typically not enough to support additional costs of the scale proposed. There is no objection to additional record-keeping which growers may do on their own time. But it is unreasonable to place the out-of-pocket burden at the lower end of the spectrum, when the commercial benefit in organics goes primarily to those closest to the consumer. Non-certified organic farmers will be effectively excluded from selling to the processing market. Some small farmers would be put out of business as a result. There is a way to avoid this problem: 1) Simplify certification; and 2) Re-allocate fees more widelu throughout the industry. 1) The largest component of certification expense to the small grower is the inspection. This can be reduced by a two-fold strategy--- A. Spot inspections: one-fifth of any group of small farms would be inspected each year. B. Enhanced transparency: The farmer's entire organic plan (minus a few well-defined financial and marketing details) would be available for public inspection. In other words, let the farmer's  customers and employees be his watchdog, in part. This will also serve as a useful trial which could be expanded if needed to other  levels of organics. 2) USDA estimates the overall cost of NOP at $4 per $l0,000 in sales. Let this be levied as a fee upon every business which transacts more than $25,000 per year in certified organic products. The exemption for very small businesses will reduce revenue, but that will be made up because many products change hands more than once before the retail transaction. Further, such a low fee will not be a burden to anyone. Payers will designate their own appropriate category, for example--- $25,000 - $50,000 : $20 fee $50,000 - $l00,000 : $40 fee  $100,000 - $200,000 : $80 fee, and so on. The exact schedule might be different from the example. The point is to spread the burden so as to avoid crushing any portion of the organic industry.   As the financial burden on certifiers is also lessened, that in turn will further reduce their fees to farmers. The bottom line will be a much higher percentage of small farmerz choosing to be certified.
