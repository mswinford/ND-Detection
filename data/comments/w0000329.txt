comment = Genetically engineered seeds or foods, or any other form of genetic engineering should not be used in any form in organic products. Genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long term health effects on humans, animals, or the environment. Furthermore, all genetically engineered foods should be labeled as such so that consumers can make informed decisions regarding the food they choose to eat. Because of the present, ill-advised decision not to require such labeling, those consumers who choose not to eat these potentially dangerous products have turned to organic foods because they are free of genetic engineering. It is very important that organic foods remain this way.
