comment = I am an organic farmer, I am certified through one of the nations certifing associations. They have strict standards and I think the NOSB probably agree with strict standards. I do not think iradiation,or sewage sludge should be accepted. However raw animal manures applied in the fall for the next years crops should be accepted.
