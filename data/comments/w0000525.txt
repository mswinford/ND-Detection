comment = I hope that you accept the recommendations of the NOSB and do the following:  1) absolutely prohibit the use of genetically engineered products, livestock, etc in any product labelled "organic." 2) prohibit the use of irradiation in any product labelled as "organic."   I am sympathetic to the view that this will put organic producers at a disadvantage, but I am quite certain that watering down the standards will put them at a bigger disadvantage, since people will be less likely to pay the higher prices for "organic" food if they know it may be irradiated or genetically altered.  One commenter makes a strong point that organic producers may have a higher rate of contamination due to their use of manures, and hence may have even greater need of irradiation than chemical growers. Nevertheless, I know that most consumers of organic foods do not want them irradiated. It is possible that irradiation in harmful. But at this point, it is a relatively new process. We used to think DDT was harmless. Let the chemical growers use it for thirty years, then if there are no effects we can talk about organic growers using it. For now, let's keep irradiation out of "organic."  If this proves to be an insurmountable hurdle in the future, it can be changed then. For now, it is important to keep the term "organic" meaning something like what people have been taking it to mean for the past twenty years. This includes neither irradiation, nor genetic engineering.  Thank you for taking my comments.
