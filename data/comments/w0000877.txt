comment = I would just like to make two brief comments.  1) I agree with many of the previous comments regarding the inclusion of biotechnology-derived, irradiated and human sewage-grown foods as 'organic'. This is taking pretty free reign with the currently accepted definition of organic - if you wish to define a new category of food, then just pick a term that isn't in current use instead of redefining one that currently has a pretty obvious meaning. However, as long as these foods were explicitly labeled as such, then it would be fine by me. Good luck trying to sell anything with a big sticker on it saying "grown in human sewage".  2) My reading of Section 205.20 is that is appears to allow any substance that is not explicitly listed as dangerous by the EPA (a "non-prohibited substance") to be used on an 'organic' farm. Now, nothing personal against the EPA, but just because they haven't tagged something as toxic doesn't mean that it's not. I would imagine that many people who eat organic food do it for reasons similar to mine - that we feel that the real dangers of unnecessary substances added to the food growing/handling process are unknown, and since they are not really needed to grow food, we'd rather not eat them.   So, if we were to be allowed to vote on this proposal, I'd vote no. Nice try, and I'm happy to see that there is becoming some interest in a national definition of organic, but I believe that you have missed it so far.  Thanks for the opportunity to comment.
