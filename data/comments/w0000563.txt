comment = Are you people quite crazy !? And, most of all how do you think that you are going to get away with this!! Those of us [and there are many of US in California particularly] are definately NOT going to let you get away with allowing Agribusiness and their CRONIES get away with hijacking organic standards. Proposals to allow non organic additives as well as bioengineered foods to be labeled as organic are plainly playing into the hands of large agribusiness and we do NOT intend to allow you to do such a thing. It is sacrilegious!!! We say BIG Business which has never been interested in anything organic until the people i.e. consumers began to purchase organic products and to demand that the foods they consume do not contain additives and are grown naturally, and we demand that big business keep it's hands off of these standards and that the government agency responsible for setting these standards stay out of bed with Big business. Listen guys and gals most people are well aware that you are in the hands of the bad guys as we see this issue. The standards set for the organic industry should be based strictly on what has been considered organic by California standards,which have been some of the strictest in the nation for many years. The organic movement began long ago in the west i.e. California as well as Oregon and we do know what is and what is not Organic. Anything which allows Sludge and non-organic products to be used in what is supposedly organic products is nothing short of trying to mislead the public and provide a very false of government standards for the organic food industry. We will not allow you to hand big agribusiness a way of circumventing strict standards as to what and what is not organic. What is organic, are foodstuffs grown without pesticides and most certainly not bio-engineered products !! Listen people, get a grip!! What you are proposing is NOT and I definatly repeat NOT organic. This reply is to docket number TMD-94-00-2.
