comment = If, and I hope you do, forbid the inclusion of genetically engineered seeds in your list of acceptable seeds for US organic production, this comment won't be relevant. However, if genetically engineered varieties are allowed: Please require all seed to be clearly labelled as genetically engineered, on all promotions, ads, packages.  Please require each and every product containing, say, Roundup Ready Soybeans, to be clearly (in big enough letters) labelled as containing genetically engineered seeds so that consumers can make the informed choice not to purchase these environmentally harmful products.
