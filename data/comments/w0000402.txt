comment = If anything from any source is organic or non organic, it should be labeled as such. Every ingredient must be labelnow what we are eating. Everything that is organic or nonorganic should be labeled so we know what we are eating. As a consumer, I want to be able to pick what I want to eat, and if there are nonorganic ingredients in a product, I want to know. Same with genetically engineered food. It must be labled. I do not want genetically engineered food and I have a right to know what is in the product I am eating and buying.
