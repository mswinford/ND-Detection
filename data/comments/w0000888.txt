comment = I am opposed to the inclusion of genetically engineered food in the definition of organic food. To me, the inclusion would make a mockery of the idea of organic. In addition, the use of irradiation should not be allowed with organic food. Irradiation is not a natural process and should not be allowed under these standards. I am also opposed to the use of municipal sludge as fertilizer for organic foods. This sludge includes human waste and is often contaminated with heavy metals and, again, this material is inconsistent with the idea of organic. I am also concerned about and opposed to the "factory-farm" process for livestock where the livestock are kept in confined quarters without room to move around. Lastly, if states or local areas have stricter standards for organic products, they should be allowed to keep and enforce these standards. Consumers choose organic foods because they are concerned about pesticides, inorganic fertilizers, bioengineering, contaminated sludge, and for standards to allow any of these things under the proposed standards essentially makes the standards meaningless.
