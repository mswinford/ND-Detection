comment = If cooking and baking are a mechanical process, as this section states, then so is irradiation. Still, since this rulemaking is all about giving consumers a better ability to make choices based on their often erroneous perceptions of reality, it follows that it is important to let those who would, avoid irradiated foods. Sidestep the whole irradiation furor by: (1) Explicitly allowing irradiation as an approved process in 205.17, but (2) establishing a dual labeling system: "Organic" and "Organic - Irradiated." If a producer chooses to label their (eligible) product as Organic, and it has been irradiated, they must use the Organic - Irradiated label.
