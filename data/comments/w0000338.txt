comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically engineered foods are an unknown many people will want to avoid them. In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so that people can choose not to consume them in any form.
