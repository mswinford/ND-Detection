comment = You must never allow genetically engineered crops to be labelled as organic. These genetically-engineered seeds are totally alien to the planet and must be labelled as such, so, we the people, have a clear choice. And, given that choice (which is the ethical path to take - surely some of you realize the risks you are taking - what about your children - once unleashed and proven catastrophic - what chance of undoing the harm that has been done) you will see that the vast majority of the public will choose natural foods over genetic manipulations. Please heed my cry for the good of your children, yourself and the rest of the poor suffering souls who reside on this magnificent earth.
