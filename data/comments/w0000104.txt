comment = I am very dissapointed to here that the following products may be labeled as organic:   1) products genetically altered via biotechnology,  2) irradiated products, 3) products fertilized with or grown in sludge, or reprocessed sewage.   I cetainly don't want to eat these types of products much less pay a premium for them.
