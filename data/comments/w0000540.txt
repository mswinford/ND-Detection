comment = Sewage sludge should NOT be allowed on organic crops. Sewage sludge has high levels of industrial waste. I was involved for 2 years on a soil chemistry research project. We applied sewage sludge on  test plots and grew crops on them. We found that the plants DID  take up and incorporate these toxic materials in plant tissues. The amount of toxics the plants incorporated was dependent on soil pH, but ALL the plants incorporated the toxins. The soil would become more toxic after years of application, and this could lead to alarming amounts of toxins in the food.   Allowing toxic waste in organic food would render the term "organic" essentially meaningless.
