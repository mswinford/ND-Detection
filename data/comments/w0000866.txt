comment = Biosolids or sludge should not be permitted or it will touch off an international debate which is not likely to be resolvable in the forseeable future. It does little to encourage growers to use the extraordinary supply of USA manures (>50,000,000 t.yr) which must be properly recycled within agriculture.  IF permitted, NOP must reference tighter metals standards such as used by the Soil Association in England, or the Germany Environmental Agency. These standards are designed to preclude accumulation of metals in soil. The EPAs 40 CFR Part 503 sludge rule does not contain adequate restrictions to prevent accumulation of metals in soil ecosystems, and is infact designed to permit accumulation in contrast to other language in the NOP rule.
