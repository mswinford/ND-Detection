comment = My family's diet consists of more than 90% organically grown grains, legumes, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Since living in Oregon, which has excellent certification standards, we have been assured of always enjoying the highest quality organic foods--free of genetic engineering, irradiation, and unsavory and potentially harmful (such as sewage) fertilizers and pesticides. I heartiliy urge that any Federal rules covering the labeling and certification of organic foods prohibit the use of genetic engineering, irradiation, and sewage fertilizer. Further, to continue to assure me, my family, and the many other people in Eugene who purchase organic foods of the high standards that Oregon has set, I  feel that Oregon and other states like it should be allowed to reject any food that doesn't meet those standards.
