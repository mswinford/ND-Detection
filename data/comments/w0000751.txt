comment =  As a consumer and mother I am very concerned about the debate on the national organic standards. If produce and meat are to be considered "Organic" they should not be genetically engineered! Animals need to be able to go outside, not to be givin antibiotics or any growth hormones and fed organic feed. And I think it is important to make room for small scale farmers who sell less than $5,000.00 worth yearly of organic meat or produce to continue not to have to pay large fees to be certified. Genetically engineered plants and food have no place being labeled as organic. This also includes irradiation. Food that is irradiated or genetically engineered should be labeled as such and NEVER be considered organic! I think if we look down the road we will see that trying to protect the earth will be in our best interests. I hope someone will read these comments and that they will save future generations to come. Thank you.
