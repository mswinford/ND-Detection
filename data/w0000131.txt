comment = The following is copied from the text in "Fees":
Under the fee for direct services provisions, labor hours, travel and per diem costs
for the site inspection required for accreditation would be included in the variable fee for
direct services. This practice is used by other USDA agencies that conduct inspection
programs. The AMS estimates the average cost to conduct each accreditation site visit to
be $3,500 per visit. The frequency of site-evaluations for each certifying agent could be
expected to decrease as the operator becomes more familiar with the program regulations. 

Is the $3,500/per visit fee for an individual farm, regardless of it's size? And will the farmer be expected to pay State fee in addition?
