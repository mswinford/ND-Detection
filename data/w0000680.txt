comment = The proposed standards for organic agriculture, though a commendable first attempt, are unacceptable because of some serious omissions and a lack of specificity in key areas. Particularly worrisome is the failure to address food irradiation, the use of genetically engineered varieties, and the application of so-called biosolids to croplands. Whether or not some government officials have proclaimed these to be safe, they cannot be construed in any way to be consistent with the mainstream idea of "organic" as more natural than standard food production. USDA considers all approved, synthetic pesticides and fertilizers to be "safe" when used as directed, correct? But they are not organic and are rightly excluded by the proposed standards. In contrast, allowing the use of the three unnatural technologies mentioned above under the label "organic" would destroy any special value in that label.

In view of the above concerns, and others likely to appear as knowledge increases, it is troubling that provisions in section 205.401 appear to constrain state organic standards programs by arbitrary and subjective criteria. This runs contrary to the trend of reform in government regulation. In welfare reform, Congress has set forth ground rules, but states make their own improvements. In clean air and water, there are basic Federal requirements, yet states can set more stringent standards. The same goes for the minimum wage, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and other things that affect people's lives.

The proposed organic standards do the opposite by setting a low ceiling on regulation of organic agricultural and food labeling practices, limiting the states' rights to scrutinize activities within their borders, and preventing them from providing consumers with more information than USDA has deemed sufficient. From this standpoint, I seriously doubt their constitutionality. Part 205.401 (3) expresses concern that stricter state standards will cause product discrimination in the marketplace. In this case, let the marketplace take care of itself, as long as we also let the democratic process take place at the state level.

Thank you for the chance to comment.
