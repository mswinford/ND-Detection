5 days and milk is organic. That's ridiculous.
You are indeed trying to give agribusiness access to the 
chic in the word organic, which is real value 
created by real loving people 

and it will not succeed.

Also, it is absolutely reprehensible that
there be no allowance for labeling to the 
effect that company's products exceeds the national
Organic Standards

Change this or face mass organized resistance and ultimate
failure
