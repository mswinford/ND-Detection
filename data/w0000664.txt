As a long-time user of organic food, I applaud the Department of Agriculture's proposal for a national certification. I join with many others in my strong concern that the proposal does not prohibit bio-engineered and irradiated foods, and I hope that before the regulations are implemented this situation is corrected. Thank you for your time and attention.
