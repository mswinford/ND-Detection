I've been purchasing certified organic foods for a few years. I am a consumer and not affiliated with any group. I'm glad that you have formalized the definition of "organic". However, I am concerned that genetically altered foods will be able to pass as organic foods. I buy whole organic foods because I am committed to sustainable agriculture and maintaining a healthy environment. I believe that genetically altered foods are not "healthy" for our environment and that they may indeed end up hurting our environment. 

In Wichita, KS, organic produce is available but not plentiful. I hope that your regulations will allow for more producers to become certified as organic resulting in more available organic produce for consumers. If organic farmers feel that your regulations will put more limitations on those already "certified", I am concerned. I hope you will listen to such organizations as the The Land Institute in Salina, Kansas, and organic growers in our State.

Thanks for this opportunity to comment.

Sincerely,
Trix Niernberger
