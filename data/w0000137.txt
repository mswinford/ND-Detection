comment = WE ARE ORGANIC FARMERS WITH THE CCOF(CALIFORNIA CERTIFIED ORGANIC FARMERS)SINCE 1987& ONE THING THAT WE HAVE SEEN IS PEOPLE DOING BUSSINESS
AS "ORGANIC" THAT WE KNEW WERE NOT. AS THE PROPOSSED LAW STANDS IT WILL HOPEFULLY WEED OUT PEOPLE THAT ARE JUST TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
POOR UNWITING PEOPLE,AND KEEP THE TERM ORGANIC UNTARNISHED. 


 LET'S KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK

 P.S. WE JUST HOPE THAT THIS WILL NOT TAKE THE BITE OUT OF THE PRIVATE 
 CETIFICATION GROUPS,SUCH AS THE CCOF,AS THEY DO KEEP EVERYONE HONEST.
