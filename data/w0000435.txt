comment = As a regular consumer of organic produce, I am dismayed that
the USDA will allow the following to be labelled organic:
- genetically engineered produce
- irradiated foods
- produce grown on land fertilized with toxic sewage sludge
- food animals raised under conditions of high antibiotic use and 
 and other hazardous chemicals (eg. insecticides sprayed on their feed)

Please adopt instead a standard for "organic" that is as stringent
as California's own definition.
