 I am a consumer of organic food products and wish that methods such
as sewage sludge, irradiation, and biotechnology be banned from the 
production of organic foods.
 The purpose of "organic" is to produce food that is free from chemicals, and have a richer nutrient content due to farming techniques.


Thank you.
