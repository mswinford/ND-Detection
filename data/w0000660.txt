comment = Irradiated food is NOT organic, it has been altered, I don't know how much, but I am unwilling to take risks with this kind of processing. Please include in your regulations a prohibition from labelling irradiated organic food as "organic". Please make food processors have to label and food or part of the food that has been irradiated.
