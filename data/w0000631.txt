comment = If I read the import program fees section correctly, you leave a loophole by not requiring payment until after AMS decides that a program IS equivalent. In other words, AMS may do the work to evaluate a program, inform the applicant that their program does NOT meet equivalency standards - all before receiving payment. AMS should be paid whether the applicant's program is determined to be equivalent or not. Require the fee to be submitted prior to notifying the applicant of the AMS equivalency decision.
