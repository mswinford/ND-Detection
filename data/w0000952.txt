comment = -These standards require that fungicide treated seed already bought by a farmer not be used if the same variety becomes available in an untreated form. Although I agree that use of fungicide treated seed should be discouraged, I believe it is wasteful to throw out seed, which for some hybrid varieties can be very expensive.
