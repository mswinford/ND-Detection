comment = Please do not allow the use of genetically manipulated material of any kind in organic production. Genetically manipulated foods have not been around long enough to know about any long-term effects on humans, animals or the environment. I do not want to take a chance on my health with them.
For me it would be best if all consumable products were labelled CLEARLY whether or not they are containing ANY genetically manipulated material. I want to be able to choose what I eat, not be left at the mercy of scientists who will decide what perhaps won't kill me in the future.
Thank you.
A very concerned Dutch citizen.
