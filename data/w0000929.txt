comment = The National Organic Standards seems to again give agribusiness the opportunity to take over a billion dollar industry which has been built up by those concerned with the environment and the health of its occupants. Genetically engineered food and chemicals must be prohibited, irradiated foods and the use of fertilizer that includes sewage sludge must all be prohibited. Please do not water down these standards!
