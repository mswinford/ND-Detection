comment = It is important to have organic food standards that are enforced and exclude all herbicides, pesticides, growth hormones, etc. The botanicals that are allowed should be restricted as well with the participation of the growing, farmworking and consumer communities. Not only is it important to ensure the safety of the consumer, the workers in the fields, residents of farming communities, water and air purity and wildlife must be protected as well.

Small family farmers, those earning under $100,000, should be exempt from any fees associated with the enforcement and certification process. This will encourage those who can least afford to be part of the process to participate. It will benefit them, wholesalers, retailers and the consumer.

All organic food produced within the U.S., its territories, and outside the U.S. must meet the same standards.

It would be helpful to know how products have reached their destination as well. Did the food reach the market via car, truck or rail primarily?

The origin of the food should be indicated and be more specific than "locally" grown. Let's include the town and state, or if outside the US, the town and country.

The effective date for the guidelines should coincide with the achievement of the provisions I have described above.
