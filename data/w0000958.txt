comment = There are three areas of concern. Purity in all forms is the basis of organic production. To start with plants with altered genetics, fertilize them with sewer sludge, and then irradiate the end produce is not my idea of a natural system that is even close to organic. As a consumer that buys these products and pays a premium to the growers not to produce the easy way,I find the inclusion of these practices to be irrational. However,I am sure the interest groups for that have financial stakes in the practices feel bending the common sence definition has great merit. If these are included the USDA will be looked upon not only irrational but just plain stupid. President Clinton wants a cleaner enviroment, a good place to start is a good clean food choice for those who want to buy ORGANIC and have it mean something. This is a chance to give consumers confidence in the products they buy. Do it right and not let it be deluted in the name of a few comercial interests.
