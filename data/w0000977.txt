 I would oppose any laws that would allow genetically

 engineered foods to be labeled organic. I believe that

 this makes it harder for organic farmers to fight

 certain pests by causing them to become resistant

 to the substances that organic farmers can use.

 I am opposed to the use of irradiation on any food

 especially organic food. There are several other 

 ways for our food sources to be treated that are a

 lot safer. I am opposed to the use of sewage sludge

 being used of organic crop land. It often contains

 toxic heavy metals and other contaminants.

 Thank you
