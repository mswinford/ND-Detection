comment = I do not feel that irradiation or genetic engineering belong in organic production systems.

I am also concerned about the possible use of sewage sludge in light of the fact that it often contains toxic heavy metals and other contaminants that accumulate in the soil. I do not feel that it can be used on organic food producting soil until our scientific technology devises a way to rid the sludge of these dangerous metals.
