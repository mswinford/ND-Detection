comment = It seems that this Proposed Rule is not narrow enough in its definition, and would allow too much produce not significantly different from other
produce in nature to be classified as Organic.

I would rather see stricter rules defining Organic Produce. Health
is the key thing here, not making it easier for the growers. If you
are not careful, the term Organic won't really mean anything and will
become nothing more than a marketing term.

Good Luck,
I realize this isn't easy, but try to keep up your standards. Because
they are OUR standards too.
