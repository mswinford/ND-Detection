comment = It is imperative that all genetically engineered organisms be excluded from any and all categories of organic foods. They should also not be considered synthetic organic foods. People have a right not to be exposed to genetically engineered organisms and organic food, above all must remain free of them.

Thank you for your attenetion to this most serious matter.
