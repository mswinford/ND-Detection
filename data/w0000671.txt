comment = This version of the rules seems to me to subvert the original intent of
the law, which was meant to differentiate between organically-produced food
and the garbage produced by large agribusiness corporations. Agribusiness
has succeeeded in lobbying to allow the rules to include *their* artificial
means of production under the rubric "organic". This travesty ought not to
be allowed; it ought to be fought, not sanctioned, by a government agency whose mandate should include keeping the public safe and informed. 

The USDA ought to be ashamed of itself if it allows itself to become yet
another propaganda organ for agribusiness--an industry whose intent is to obfuscate, not inform. People should be allowed a *genuine* choice about the food they choose to eat. These rules, if adopted, would deprive people of that choice.
