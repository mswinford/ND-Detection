comment = For organic food as a label to make any sense and carry any weight the allowance of transgenetics, irradiation, and foods grown on land fertilized with sewage sludge CANNOT be allowed. As a consumer organic implies natural to some extent and while I think it is a a step in the right direction that a federal definition of organic is being established... I thinkt that such a standard should MEAN something.
