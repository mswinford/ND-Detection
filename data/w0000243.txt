comment = The proposal, as I have read it, is intended to be deliberately misleading to the consumer and therefore incompatible with the basic truth in labeling laws of many states. My hope has always been that the USDA set an example as it is a servant of taxpaying public consumer and should not be influenced by the special interests of corporations who contribute their political bonuses to panels charged with protecting the *public* interest. Those of us who purchase organic food do so for a reason: confidence that the USDA is being truthful, critical, and correct in defining the word 'organic'. Why not make this very easy for everyone and do your job. For foods that are irradiated, label then 'Irradiated Organic', for those foods exposed to sewage or other farm chemicals the label might read 'Faux Organic', and for those foods based upon genetically altered 'Modified Organic'. Or, do what makes the most sense and label only those foods grown truly organic (non-pesticide, non-irradiation, non-sewage, non-genetic) as 'Organic' and anything else as *explicitly* non-organic.
