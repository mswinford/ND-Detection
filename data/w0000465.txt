comment = At this point, I've only read portions of the proposed rule. I wanted to make some high-level comments as soon as I could before attempting to review it in detail (which I may never be able to do, in any case). 

My understanding is that the proposed national program allows a number of practices (such as genetic engineering and use of certain toxic materials) that I would not consider organic. Furthermore, I would not eat food that was considered 'organic' under the standards of the proposed rule. I also understand that this set of standards would make it a crime to enforce higher standards at a state or local level. I think this is absurd. In essence, the government is using its power to ignore the interests of the consumer in favor of the interests of international commerce. At the very least, local governmental or non-governmental agencies or groups should be allowed to publish their own sets of organic standards, and organic farmers should be able to choose which sets of standards they wish to adhere to without running the risk of being thrown into jail, or paying heavy fines, for their organic beliefs.

That's all for now. As stated, I hope to be able to make a more complete comment after reviewing the proposed rules in more detail. Thanks for allowing me this chance to comment.
