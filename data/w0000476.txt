comment = I started buying organic foods about three years ago and shop for almost all of my groceries at health food stores. I chose organic products for health reasons--that of my family and the environment. I have trusted the strict California definition of "organic" on the labels of the foods I buy.

If the USDA definition of organic includes foods that are irradiated, genetically engineered, or are grown with human sewage, all of which I consider very INorganic, how am I supposed to find the truly organic foods I want? The label won't tell me what I need to know!

Don't give in to the food producers who want to change the definition of organic--solely for their own profit. This is a democracy and the government must listen to the people! (Or am I being unrealistically idealistic in assuming we should follow the words of the Constitution?)
