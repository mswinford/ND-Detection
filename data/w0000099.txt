comment = I am outraged as a consumer that irradiated foods, gentically engineered foods, and foods grown
on lands fertilized with sewage sludge are included in the USDA's proposed rules for organic
foods. These practices have never been a part of organic food agriculture. Inclusion of these
types of foods is irresponsible. I hope this rule serves one purpose--to convince people to
grow their own healthy organic foods and not be victimized by federal macromanagement strategies 
that pander to large-scale agribusinesses. This rule is indicative of how mainstream 
macromanagement policies continue to corrupt what is a God given right for all who inhabit 
Earth--access to healthy foods. I enjoy the fruits of a 38 acre burgeoning farm in the Blue
Ridge mountains of Virginia, but for those who depend on responsible agricultural practices
to provide their families with healthy foods, all I can say is "God help you because the 
government will not."
