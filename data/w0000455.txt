1) Animals should not be allowed to be slaughtered and butchered and receive
an organic label. If a live animal is to be categorized, it may receive an organic 
label if it only received feed which was grown and processed without use of 
genetic engineering, irradiation, and municipal sewage sludge.

2) Prohibiting genetically engineered foods should include not only the use
of genetically engineered seeds, but genetically engineered (or GE-derived)
fertilizers or other agricultural inputs, as well as foods produced from
genetically engineered sources or using genetically engineered processing
agents or their derivatives (e.g., rennets, enzymes such as amylase, etc.).

3) Irradiation should be prohibited under the organic label. It has been
closely associated with genetic engineeering in that it can create novel
chemical structures, particularly novel proteins, whose bioactivity is
completely unknown and unpredictable. It also fosters continued reliance on
nuclear technologies in general, and simply doesn't fit into the traditional
organic orientation.

4) Use of municipal sewage sludge as organic fertilizer should be banned.
Quite aside from the human waste issue, organic accreditation boards have
decried sewage as contaminated with heavy metals such as cadmium and lead,
which are readily absorbed by many crops.
