comment = As a consumer of organic produce, specifically community-supported local agriculture, and as a biomedical scientist, I strongly support the recomendations of the NOSB on the use of genetically-engineered organisms and irradiation. The full extent of the impact of these production methods have yet to be determined, and it would be irresponsible to allow for the products of these methods to be labelled as organic. These methods may yet be shown to provide a risk-free benefit to food production, and further development of them is certainly warrented. However, they have no place in the current definition of organic farming.
