comment = Dear USDA,

As a medical doctor and scientist I believe it is absolutely essential that organic crops be completely free of all genetic engineering. We are going to reap what we sow. If we sow genetically engineered crops, we will reap dire consequences.
We are playing God with a level of nature that we don't yet fully understand. There is no long term research on the effects of releasing genetically engireered crops into the food supply or environment. Unlike a nuclear explosion whose fallout deterioates over time, genetically manipulated organisms cannot be recalled from the environment once released. 

We must keep the purity ot the organic lable.

Please don't listen to the big bucks lobbying dollars. Please protect the future generations. Keep genetically engineered crops completely out of the organic market.

Sincerely,



Michael Busch, M.D., Ph.D
