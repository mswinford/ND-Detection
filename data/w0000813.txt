comment = At present true wild salmon has been overlooked as being added to the current list regulations that would enable it to be identified and labled as 100% Organic. Currently without this USDA seal of certification farm salmon is sometimes sold as wild salmon in most major retail outlets in the U.S. With the consumer being misled as to the true oragin of the salmon they are purchasing. Farm salmon has its place in the market, but not in the organic market. Please add wild salmon and wild salmon producers to the regulations so we can protect the value and reputation of our truely organic salmon.

Thank you for this opportunity to respond.
