comment = I own and operate a 160 acre certified organic farm in Colorado. I strongly oppose
genetically engineered organisms being included under the organic label. 

First, the reason that organics is the only food growth industry today is that more
and more people want to buy and eat food grown naturally; they want natural food
grown in a natural way--food in tune with nature. Genetically engineered products
are NOT natural--such organisms with artificially spliced DNA could never evolve
naturally even over billions of years. To label genetically engineered organisms
as organic will make the organic label meaningless, and therefore destroy
consumer interest in this segment of the food industry.

Secondly, whenever a “foreign” plant is introduced into the native plant culture,
problems result. Invasive foreign plants can often outcompete native species,
destroying the “balance of power” between co-existing native plants. When native
plants lose ground to introduced foreign plants, all the native bird, insect and
wildlife species that depend on the native plants also begin to die out. One of the
worst problems facing agriculture today has to do with controlling aggressive
non-native plants. What could be more non-native than a genetically
introduced organism? Once these plants escape into the environment, we cannot
recall them. Do not encourage the propagation of genetically engineered organisms
by allowing them to be part of the fast-growing organic food industry!
