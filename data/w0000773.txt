comment = Dear Sirs: 

I am willing to pay considerably more for "organic" meat, milk, 
eggs, and fish and to do without until I can find the organic version.

When I buy "organic" animal products, I want to know that I am buying 
from animals that meet these conditions: 

1. Were not genetically engineered or cloned (selective breeding is ok, 
 but genetic engineering is not)
2. Did not eat food the animal wouldn't normally eat if humans weren't
 around to feed it: that is, herbivores are not being fed ground-up
 remains of other animals (I wish to avoid salmonella, prions, etc.)
 and are not being fed industrial waste products such as 
 ground up paper, wood, or cardboard. 
 The animal also should not be given growth hormones
 and should not be fed foods that have been sprayed with pesticides
 or that have been genetically engineered to withstand treatment with
 pesticides. 
3. That the animal is raised in an environment that promotes good 
 health without drugs and antibiotics; that it receives antibiotics 
 only in response to an existing infection; and that it is raised 
 without other drugs such as tranquilizers or growth hormones. 
4. That the animal is raised in conditions where it can move around 
 and develop and use its muscles; where it can socialize with 
 other animals (this promotes activity and health) in a healthy way,
 and where it can go outside and breathe fresh air.

Thank you for the opportunity to state my preference.
