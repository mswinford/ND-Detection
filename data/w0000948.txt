-Phrases such as “produced without synthetic pesticides” present a significant challenge to making labeling rules that are fair to all producers and consumers. I don’t look kindly on producers who use these terms to promote their products as “green” when they really are not very committed to the concepts of sustainable agriculture and ecosystems. At the same time their are producers who are doing everything they can to achieve sustainability but still are not able to be organic given the market conditions or other reasons. A good example are ecologically oriented apple producers in the Northeast. It is virtually impossible to grow apples in this climate organically without doing more damage to the ecosystem than if the apples were grown using a minimal pesticide program. As a result some producers raise and market their apples as “ecologically grown.” This potential marketing claim should not be prohibited from being used by honest producers. The only compromise I can think of is that producers or growers marketing a non organic product and making a claim that may imply that it is organic, also make a disclaimer that is in plain view (primary display label) stating that the product is “not certified organic.”
