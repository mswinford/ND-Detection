comment = It is important that the use of the word "organic" indicate the purest possible commodity available. The use of irradiation is unacceptable. The use of biogenitic seeds is unacceptable. The use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers in any way, shape, or form is unacceptable. The use of any product that may (such as sewage sludge) cause contamination of an otherwise pure product is unacceptable. 

Handling of these products must also be in the "organic" mindset, and, therefore, without the use of contaminants. 

"Organic" livestock must not use any form of hormone therapy or other such contamination. Feed for this livestock must also be from "organic" sources. Vacination to prevent disease is acceptable. 

It is very important that the USDA be very careful in what they will allow to be considered "organic." It is time to take a stand against the pollution we have allowed into our food stream, as well as our water, soil, and air. Please, please, please, ensure the wellness of our food production by allowing only pure and uncontaminated products be called "organic." Do not allow the large agribusinesses to dictate the rules by which "organic" will be certified and labeled. 

All that are a part of the establishment of these rules must ensure (by conscience, morality and ethics) that the future of organic be just that, organic, without the use of bioengineered anything, plastic anything, petro-chemical based anything. I truly believe that the future of our species and earth are dependent on a return to more basic practices, especially in agriculture. 

Thank You.
