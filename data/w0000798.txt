comment = The USDA Organic Standards should follow those recommended by the National Organic Standards Board. Specifically, organic standards should not allow inclusion of genetically engineered organisms or other GE additives in any foods labeled "organic". In additions, irradiated foods and food exposed to sewage sludge should not be part of our food supply. Consumers should be able to turn to organically grown food as their safe haven from these toxic additives.
Thank you for allowing this comment.
