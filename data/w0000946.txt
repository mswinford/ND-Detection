comment = I will be very disappointed and angery if the additional bureaucracy results in an increase in certification fees over what I currently pay. One other area of concern is what procedure will be used to augment or change the standards in the future. It is my hope that this authority will not be allowed to be taken over by big business, resulting in softening and corruption.
