comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of
genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human
health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as
such so that I can choose not to consume them in any form.

There should be requirements established that ALL organic crops/livestock
are certified to be free of genetically engineered seeds, fertilizers,
and/or food fed to organic livestock.
