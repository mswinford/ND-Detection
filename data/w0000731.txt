comment = I am a high school student preparing a presentation for an environmental issues class. Though I thoroughly reviewed your site, I was unable to discover the USDA's stance on bio-engineering and irradiation on organically labeled food. I believe that both of these are extremly important issues that must be adressed in the new regulations. As these are regulations that are being created in order to keep the consumer informed, I believe it important that ALL the issues are adressed. If someone in the USDA could contact me with information on this, or make an addition to the site, it would be greatly appreciated. Please contact EQdelmar@aol.com

Thankyou,
