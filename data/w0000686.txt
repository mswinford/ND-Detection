comment = The definition of organic should be determined by concensus among those
who have been growing, eating, selling, and promoting organic food over the
long term--not by industrial ambitions or popular vote. At a minimum,
organic implies *natural from start to finish*. Diluting the meaning of
organic is a crime against nature and a crime against consumers who have
demonstrated a burgeoning interest in organic products.
