comment = I love the idea of having legal standards for the use of the word "organic" for foods, however, as the USDA rules stand right now, the word becomes meaningless. Irradiated, genetically engineered foods, and foods grown with human waste need to be removed from being considered organic foods. In fact, I think that foods that are grown that way should be labeled as such. The consumer has a right to know what they are buying. Even if the government does decide that it is safe enough for people to eat it. It should be the consumer that decides whether they want to buy it or not. And they can't do that unless they have the proper information. 

Once the term "organic" has been finalized, I would like to see the USDA work on the use of the word "natural", because as it stands right now, anything on this planet can be considered natural. But when the consumer sees the word "natural", they think that it means that the product does not contain anything artificial additives, and that it would have minimal processing. I know that the Federal Trade Commission recommended standards for food products labeled "natural" in the 1980's, but Congress tabled the issue and it never came up again for review. It needs to be brought up again.

Thanks for reading my comments.
