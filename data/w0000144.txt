comment = Oranicially grown foods are part of our family's diet for some years. I am pleased to see that the USDA is working towards standard Organic labelling. 
However, I was appalled to read that you might include under Organic
foods irridated, grown with sludge or bioenginered. Doesn't government
have enough credibility problems? If it's organic, it's not
bioenginered, or irridated, or grown with sludge. It shouldn't take a
great deal of intellengence to figure out that people who pay more for
organic foods, do so because they want a choice they aren't getting in
the larger market place. If you include irridated, bioenginered or
'sludged' foods under the organic heading, you will have once more time
held your department and the process of governmental regulation up for
ridicule. The effectiveness of the Organic label will be seriously
weakened, and people like me will be asking the questions about how it
was grown, one more time. The organic growers will have to develop
another label distinguishing their products from those irridated, etc.
You're on the right track, don't derail now.
Sincerely,
Ann Baker
