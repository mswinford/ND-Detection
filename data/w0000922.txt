comment = The published National List does not include methoprene, a mosquito larvicide. This material, which the USEPA has exempted from crop tolerances, acts as an insect growth regulator. It is not applied to the crops, but rather to the water where mosquitoes develop. It is a good product to use when the existing water has a high organic load. Bt products do not not work well in these situations.
