comment = I support a national standard for the certification and labelling of organic food.

I urge the USDA to strengthen the proposed standard by prohibiting the use of sewage sludge, irradiation, genetic engineering, and cannibalistic animal feed in the production of food to be certified as organic.

As a consumer, I expect organic foods to be pure and healthy, grown as naturally as possible, and free from synthetic processing. 
While the previously mentioned techniques may be valuable in mass-producing food, I do not believe they have been studied adequately to be considered safe. I value the opportunity to choose foods produced without these methods.

Further, I urge you to extend the time allowed for public feedback. Ninety days is such a short time to consider such an important issue. 

Sincerely,

Kelly Anderson
