comment = This subsection says nothing about the use of irradiation as a prohibited processing method. I strongly believe that no plant or animal product or derivative that has been irradiated at any point in its processing should be allowed to be labeled as "organic." Only nonirradiated food products should be allowed to carry the label of "organic."
