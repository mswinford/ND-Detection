I THINK ITS WORTHY OF MENTION THAT THE USDA IS OUT OF THE DOCUMENT.
HOW THEY CAN ALLOW THIS TO OCCUR RIGHT FROM 12\15\97 THE ANNOUNCEMENT
DATE IS GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND OR CRIMINAL.ITS ACTIONABLE. LET ME BE 
VERY CLEAR.SINCE 12\15\97 I HAVE CONTACTED THE USDA AND PAID FOR 
[THE PROPOSED ORGAMIC STANDARDS] DOCUMENT.I HAVE SPOKE TO 10 USDA PEOPLE
INCLUDING DAN GLICKMANS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT ENRIQUA FIGUROA.THE 
TONE OF THE ENTIRE OFFICE IS UNHELPFUL AND ILLWILLED.ITS OUT IT WILL
BE AFTER THE 1ST OF THE YEAR BEFORE WE HAVE IT. WHEN I MENTION THE 
90 DAY COMMENT PRERIOD ENDS 03\16\98 THEY GET EVEN MORE OBSTINENT,NASTY,
AND MEAN SPIRITED.
I HAVE REPORTED THE BEHAVIOR TO RON KIND,RUSS FIEGOLD,PAUL WELLSTONE,
AND RON WYDEN SO THERE IS A RECORD OF MY EFFORTS TO GET THE DOCUMENT
WITHOUT BEING ABUSED BY USDA PERSONEL.IN A TIMELY FASHION?!!!

IF YOU ARE HAVING SIMILAR PROBLEMS PLEASE CONTACT ME.I AM KEEPING A RECORD.
