I am a retailer of natural foods and vitamins, and a faithful consumer of "Organic foods. I am writing because I am against the proposal to a allow geneticaly modified plants to be labeled Organic. My feelings are this. I do not like the idea of putting things that are scientificaly "modified" into my system. I also know that there are many other consumers that feel the same way, they are my customers. I know that this will not be a good thing for the market. Who knows what will happen to the Nutritional Values. And what will it do to the ecosystem?
Again I say, I AM AGAINST THE PROPOSAL!
