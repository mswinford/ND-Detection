comment = The idea that the USDA would consider making a rule that defined organic food as (1) irradiated, (2) grown with sewage sludge as fertilizer, or (3) treated with genetically altered materials is ludicrous. If these items are included in the definition of organic it will only serve to create two meanings for the word. There will be "classic organic" and "USDA organic" foods on the market. I expect that people who by organic food today will not choose the USDA organic variant which begs the question, "Who will buy it?"
