I am sending this message to inform you of my opinions and thoughts regarding the establishment of Federal Standards for organic products.

While I'm pleased that the Federal government is finally creating a standard for the whole country, I have some concerns with certain aspects of those standards. In particular, the possible use of sewage sludge, genetic engineering and food irradiation concern me.

Here in California we already have a very fine organic standards set by the state. As far as I know, none of these three items are allowed in organic foods here. I don't see the need to include them at this point. While, I'm not a scientist ,nor do I understand all the pros and cons of these three proposals, I am a consumer and I do not wish to buy products in which these processes are involved.

At this point these three seem too untried. With too many unanswered questions regarding their effects on humans and the environment. For many people, choosing organic is not an easy choice or a convenient one. If it cost more and is not as easy to buy, why should I accept less if I go out of my way to purchase it.

I believe the Federal government establishing standards is long overdue and a step in the right direction, but I believe we should proceed carefully and not include these three processes.

Thank you for taking the time for my opinions.
