comment = Thank you for the opportunity to respond. I am a very happy consumer
to be sure that the USDA is going to require certification as organic
to try and ensure that fraudulent claims for organics will try and be
controlled. I just hope that this effort will not discourage small
family farms (farmers) from certifying because of administrative 
costs which could prove cost prohibitive. Additionally, I have a 
concern: Acknowledge whether or not labeling will require if any 
ingredients which are known allergens, such as wheat, whey, soy, dairy
etc. will consistently be listed on lables...as they are in other countries
currently. In the US often times the fillers and lesser ingredients are
either not identified or listed completely. For those of us who are
chemically sensitive and or allergic PLEASE require Complete listing of
all ingredients....I recognize that because of wind drift and living on 
a polluted planet we cannot have pure food any longer, just require that
INGREDIENTS AND FILLERS BE LISTED COMPLETELY.....
 
Thank you!!!
