comment = As a consumer, when I purchase organic products, I expect the products to be:

- Grown without pesticides, fungicides (of any type)
- Grown without synthetic fertilizers
- Non-irradiated
- Not bioengineered
- Grown with environmentally sensitive methods

When I purchase dairy products, I expect the animals producing the products to:

- Be fed organically grown feed.
- Be afforded free range time
- Not be given antibiotics as an additive into their diets


This is important to me as a consumer, getting the peace of mind knowing that I am providing my family with the healthiest, safest products available. The markets that I shop in, and farmer's booths, that I frequent at the farmers' market follow the same understanding by selling products that are certified organic by the CCOF.

I am pleased with the growing selection of organic products available and hope that more farmers become inclined to choose organic methods of farming. I do not wish to see the definitions broadened to include agricultural methods that do not fall within my definition.

Thank you for this opportunity to present my opinion.
