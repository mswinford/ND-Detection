comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic crop production. I do not want to consume them. We do not know what the long-term affects of eating genetically engineered produce/livestock would be. Also, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so that I can choose not to purchase or consume them. Using synthetic substances would no longer be organic. (See Webster's New Dictionary (Concise Edition); 1990; "synthetic ... produced by chemical synthesis, rather than of natural origin; not real; artificial."

Thank you.
