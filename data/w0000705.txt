I am appalled at the idea of using sewage sludge as a product allowable on organically produced vegetables and fruits. I have just this evening in gardening chat rooms at four locations come across people who have been exposed to the spreading of
municiple wastes and find that they are all exibiting flu like symptoms or rashes and sores accompanied by fever. Last month,
I pointed out to the USSWC rep here that hog waste is not automatically checked for heavy metals in the present state waste analyis program that is available on a voluntary basis. 
Overall, genetically engineered plants and sewage sludge is not what I have in mind when I buy produce. It is not what I have in mind when I produce my organic fertilizer and am insulted by septic residues which in their use, not in their analysis, are allowed to be used on my food.
