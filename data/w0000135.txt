comment = I am an OCIA certified sprout grower in wisconsin.
I am very concerned about the watering down of organic standards to accomodate agri-business' profit needs.
This is about health - the bottom line is the health of the planet we live on. If we continue to poison the Earth, not only will we be eating food
which is obviously poorer and poisoned, but we will have no place to live.
Soiling one's nest is idiotic and short sited. In just a couple hundred years we have threatened an environment which has been developing for 4 billion years. We can NOT expect the planet to sustain us if we do not nurture it - it is only, after all, a holder of limited resources.
