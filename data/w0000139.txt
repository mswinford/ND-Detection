comment = This truth in organic labeling has been a long time coming!! I shop at 
several stores and travel many miles to purchase TRUE CERTIFIED GROWER 
ORGANIC. I also agree with Merrill Clark, Michigan whoes comments were
published in the Detroit Free Press regarding organic meat. If the beef
has EVER been injected with antibiotics, during any part of life, IT CANNOT
BE LABELED ORGANIC. I am very opposed to the use of pesticides, herbicides, genetic engineered and irradiated food. The strawberries
from Mexico should answer any questions with regard to how anyone would
feel about the use of sewer sludge being used to fertilize ANY FOOD. 
I am also opposed to the fact the USA has banned DDT and other chemicals
use on food here in the states yet we sell it to Mexico and other countries 
and they spray it on their farms then we purchase it back and sell it in our supermarkets! 

Lets not "water" down these Organic Food Rules. Lets keep them strong
and true. A little bit organic is like being a little bit pregnant.
It is either organic or it is not organic.
