comment = Section 205.17b should prohibit food irradiation of products labeled as organic.
The potential irradiation has to produce chemicals adverse to human health
is too high to allow this practice in organic farming. It is not
consistent with the concept of organic in most minds as
something produced naturally, and to allow irradiated produce
to be labeled as organic would be misleading.
