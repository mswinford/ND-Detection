comment = As a tree farmer I am more inclined to be a concerned consumer than producer. 
I want no part of genetically modified organisms, food irradiation, and sewage fertilizer.
The Europeans have been using Oxegenated water (03) as cleansing agent. It is also beginning to be recognized here in the states. This all natural cleansing attacks the cellular structure of many well known pathogens and then converts back to regular water and air. No irradiation, no chemicals, no wast products.
This technology is easy and simple to use and could (should be) adopted thru out the food processing industry.
Please look into this safe and HIGHLY effective form of food washing/sterilization.
Thank you in advance for all considerations.
Scott Galloway
