comment = As a consumer I have the right to choose what I eat. Personally I do not want to eat genetically engineered foods. It should be required that genetically engineered foods, or foods containing genetically engineered ingredients, be labeled as such. Genetically engineered foods should not be represented or labeled as organic.
