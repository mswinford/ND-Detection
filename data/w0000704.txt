comment = I am very concerned at the lack of legitimate standards for the term "organic" in the foods I choose to buy and serve my family. The reason I purchase organic is to insure that we will not be eating irradiated and or chemically treated foods. I do not want preservatives or pesticides permitted in the production of my food.
