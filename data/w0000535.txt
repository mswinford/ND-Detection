comment = Is it really impossible to put our, (the consumer), interest above all.
It is true, we have no lobbyists floating around Washington, with bags full of money, "contributing" to the "Electoral Process".

Is it really impossible to stick to certain principles and not cave in to special corporate interest groups. Why is it almost always necessary to water-down laws that protect the interest of the consumer?

This watered down proposal is just as foolish as calling manufactured items, NOT wholy manufactured in the US, "MADE IN THE USA".

We, myself, wife, seven children and 6 grandchildren, really would like to eat food untainted with chemicals, or residuals.

Please stick to certain minimal principles.
