comment = Allowance of 5% of the allowed EPA tolerance of ANY pesticide in certified products (in the event of "unavoidable residual environmental contamination") is contrary to the public's expectations. 

There is no mention of how such "unavoidable... contamination" is to be documented by the producer. 

Most conventionally produced foods (about 90%) are within 10% of EPA tolerance of allowed pesticides, and at least 50% have no detectable residues at all. Allowing the 5% mentioned seems much too lenient for something that is supposed to be "CERTIFIED" organic, and misleads the consumer.
