comment = I want to add my support to exluding genetically engineered plants, irradiation, and fertilizer from municipal sludge from the definition of organic food. These are all are contrary to my expectations of organic food. I applaud the effort at developing a national standard, but if these are allowed, it will be meaningless. I would like to see all genetically engineered plants and irradiated foods clearly labeled, whether organic or not.
