The
most
important
thing
to
me
in
being
a
US
citizen
is
in
having
freedom
of
choice.
I
can
choose
those
things
that
I
feel
is
best
for
me,
my
health,
my
needs,
my
happiness.
I
know
that
laws
can
be
passed
that
are
considered
best
for
the
majority
of
citizens,
but
there
are
cases
where
the
law
should
not
prevent
one?s
freedom
of
choice.
The
proposal
to
allow
genetically
engineered
foods
into
the
organic
market
is
such
a
case.
It
may
be
that
the
majority
of
citizens
accept/ignore
genetically
engineered
organisms,
and
it
is
their
choice
to
do
so,
but
many
do
not,
and
for
them
the
choice
should
also
exist.
When
I
go
to
the
grocery
store
I
want
to
be
able
to
choose
those
products
I
feel
would
enhance
my
health
and
happiness.
Please
do
not
take
this
choice
away
from
me.
Genetically
engineered
foods
have
not
been
adequately
tested
for
their
long
term
effects
on
people,
animals
or
environment.
A
law
passed
should
demand
that
all
genetically
engineered
foods
should
be
labelled
as
such.Evans

Calling
genetically
engineered
food
products
organic
is
a
gross
misuse
of
the
english
language.
Do
not
include
genetically
engineered
food
items
for
human
and/or
animal
consumption
in
any
of
the
proposed
Organic
Standards.
A
moratorium
should
be
called
on
development
of
all
genetically
engineered
products
untill
a
panel
of
expert
scientists
have
completed
a
long
term
study
on
the
environment
impact
and
long
term
human
and
animal
health
impact
of
genetically
engineered
products

Once
again,
the
USDA
reveals
itself
as
a
tool
for
agribusiness,
biotech
and
chemical
companies,
and
supermarket
chain
stores!Organic
food
IS
NOT:-irradiated-factory
farmed-genetically
engineered-grown
in
non-organic
soil-sprayed
with
pesticides!Leave
private
and
state
organic
certification
bodies
to
maintain
stricter
organic
standards
than
those
the
USDA
requires.USDA
is
going
to
arouse
IMMENSE
public
distrust
of
the
government
if
it
starts
tampering
with
the
food
America
feeds
it's
children.LEAVE
ORGANIC

Please
do
not
allow
genetically
engineered
seedsor
any
other
aspect
of
genetic
engineering
to
be
usedin
organic
production.
Because
geneticallyengineered
foods
have
not
been
tested
for
theirlong-term
effects
on
human
health,
on
animals,or
on
the
environment,
I
do
not
want
to
consume
them.In
fact,
I
would
like
to
see
all
genetically
engineeredfoods
labelled
as
such
so
that
I
can
choose
notto
consume
them
in
any
