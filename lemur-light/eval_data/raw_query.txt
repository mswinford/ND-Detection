Once again, the USDA reveals itself as a tool for agribusiness, biotech and chemical companies, and supermarket chain stores!Organic food IS NOT:-irradiated-factory farmed-genetically engineered-grown in non-organic soil-sprayed with pesticides!Leave private and state organic certification bodies to maintain stricter organic standards than those the USDA requires.USDA is going to arouse IMMENSE public distrust of the government if it starts tampering with the food America feeds it's children.LEAVE ORGANIC FOOD ALONE!Kathi KennedySan Francisco

Please do not allow genetically engineered seedsor any other aspect of genetic engineering to be usedin organic production. Because geneticallyengineered foods have not been tested for theirlong-term effects on human health, on animals,or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineeredfoods labelled as such so that I can choose notto consume them in any form.
