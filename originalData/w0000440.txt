comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds
or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used
in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their
long-term effects on human health, on animals,
or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered
foods labelled as such so that I can choose not
to consume them in any form.
