comment = Having not yet read the whole proposed rule, a general scan of its overall intent illicts the following comment:

Fatally flawed and not in keeping with the organic standards traditions of California, Oregon and others that conerned consumers like myself have come to trust as indicators of food grown according to the healthiest, most ecologically responsible and sustainable fashion.

The principal flaws contrary to the spirit of what I know as "organic:" 1)the inclusion of synthetic substances, by approval on lists, by the fact of their inert nature, by virtue of their biogenetic origin and so on 2) the use of percentages to identify organics.

As a consumer, and a cunsumer of the food, I most want clear, unambiguous labeling that does not hide in any way any ingredient, any process that is synthetic, biogentic, irradiated, in other words, not organic.

 The proposed standards would, in my opinion, allow any number of synthetically derived, pesticide-produced, inorganically processed, biogenetic, irradiated products to claim the label organic. 

Who can this benefit other than the mainstream food industry, not the organic farmers who have worked in a spirit of high, exacting standards that truly represent the interests of health and environment.

Rewrite the standards. Otherwise you render the label organic meaningless and turn it into a subversive, misleading term useful in promoting continued ill health and bad agricultural practices.
