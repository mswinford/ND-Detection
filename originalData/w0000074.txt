comment = The fees are high. The farmer typically works very hard. To have a certifying agent ask a few questions, take a few samples, leave, and that agency collecting these exhorbitant fees is absolutely cruel.

Why do we have to be certified? Why not simply "verified?" Why don't we just have our land grant universities have a shot at this? Let's have the Cooperative Extension Agents get out from behind those desks and out in the field where they all began decades ago?

Let them verify our crops. I'd much rather pay the Cooperative Extension a fee, than a private certifying agency.

LET THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION AGENTS "VERIFY". THEY'VE BEEN AWAY FROM FIELD WORK FOR TOO LONG NOW. THEY HAVE BEEN A PHENOMENAL SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND HELP TO THE FARMERS. THEY ARE THE ONES WHO "DECODED" THE HIGH-TECH USDA LANGUAGE FOR THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. HEY, USDA! REMEMBER THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION?
