With regards to allowing 80% organic feed to be used when organic is not available verses the 100% currently
required today, I fully am against the lowering from 100% to 80% and do not believe that this allowance will
serve the consumer, rather it will work against them.

It seems to be common knowledge that when something is required, the market has a way of coming up
with it, as is the case now with the 100% requirement. This 100% gives farmers an incentive to produce
100% organic feed for livestock thus creating a market for organic feed. The rational that 80% can be used
when organic is unavailble is so ambiguous and gray in nature that it seems to be a standard simply being
to be abused. There will ALWAYS be organic feed available if IS REQUIRED. The only time there won't
be organic feed available is if it required that ONLY 80% is necessary, thus creating a market for 20% of
non organic feed.

Thank you for your consideration,

Sincerely,

Claudia Tomaso
