I do not find the following acceptable as part of organic standards:

1) Irridated products
2) Genetically engineered products
3) Drugs of any kind
4) Raw manure or sludge

PLEASE do not relax organic standards to the point that the word becomes meaningless!! 
I beg you!!!!

Sincerely,

Vonalda M. Utterback
