Being a concerned citizen, and an enviormentalists, I would like to comment on the proposal to include biotechnology, sludge, and irradiation under organic. I have been eating organic foods for years, but if thoses practices were included under organic, I would not. Organic means pure. Those practices are unproven, can be economically unfair (biotechnology), and promote the use of radiation (which we certainly don't need more of in the environment...do I need to remind you that the cancer rate is 40% and rising!). Thanks for listening.
