comment = Dear USDA,

I applaude your initiative of proposing uniform standards for Organic Foods. 
However, I object to the possible inclusion of irradiation, antibiotics used in the production of livestock and dairy and the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer. Organic is associated with "natural" (food and methods of producing and processing food). None of the methods listed above can be certified as natural. Allowing these would undermine the credility of the entire standard.

Thank you for allowing me to comments on the proposed rules
