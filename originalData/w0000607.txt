comment = The use of any ingredients that are derived from genetically engineered organisms (bacterial, plant or animal), or processes which use substances from genetically engineered organisms (e.g. enzymes from bacteria, yeast) should be excluded from the definition of organic foods.

Genetic engineering is an imprecise technology with inherent unpredictabilty capable of unexpectedly giving rise to novel toxins and allergens. The exclusion of genetically engineered ingredients in organic foods gives the concerned consumer the choice of avoiding the extra risks associated with these developments.
