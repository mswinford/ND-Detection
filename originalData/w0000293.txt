comment = I feel very strongly about this issue. 

Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic 
engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on 
animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them, or support their 
production. In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labeled as such 
so that I can choose not to consume them in any form.

I wish to know what the make up of my food 
source is and I want a safe haven for unaltered food -- This safe haven is the organic 
market. Please honor this wish. Strong free enterprise is based on strong market 
knowledge. Let people make their own choice. 

You will be honored in history for your foresight in creating a safe haven. If there is a 
chance of error or problems with genetically engineered material, then best to act most 
CONSERVATIVELY. NO GENETICALLY ENGINEERED MATERIAL IN THE ORGANIC 
MARKET. Thank you for you consideration.
