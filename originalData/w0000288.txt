comment = NONE OF THE PROPOSED RULES DEAL WITH THE REAL WORLD OF BEING A FARMER. $50,000 GROSS SALES MEANS TO MOST FARMERS A NET INCOME OF LESS THAN $5,000. THE AMOUNTS BEING SUGGESTED ARE FAR TOO SMALL TO ALLOW SMALL FULL TIME FARMERS TO CONTINUE AS ORGANIC PRODUCERS. MOST OF OUR CROP IS SOLD LOCALLY AND WE DONT CARE ABOUT THE EXPORT PROBLEMS. LET THE BIG OPERATORS PAY FOR THEIR INTERNATIONAL CERTIFICATIONS WITHOUT SADDLING US WITH THIS CERTIFICATION PAPER WORK. 

I THINK THAT THE USDA SHOULD ALLOW AN ORGANIC CERTIFICATION EXEMPTION UP TO A REASONABLE INCOME FOR A FAMILY FARM. 

HOW MUCH DOES IT COST FOR THE MIDDLE LEVEL FEDERAL EMPLOYEE TO LIVE? START WITH THIS MID-INCOME WAGE AND MULTIPLY BY 10 TO ALLOW FOR PRODUCTION EXPENSES OF THE FARMERS CROP. 

FORGET THE OTHER NUMBERS IN YOUR SUGGESTED RULES AND ALLOW A TOTAL FARM INCOME FROM ALL AGRICULTURE SOURCES OF A LIVING WAGE.
