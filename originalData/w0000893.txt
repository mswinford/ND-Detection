comment = I am a consumer of organically grown foods, and I am greatly OPPOSED to the rule. The reasons I choose to eat these foods is that current standards uphold a guarantee that no pesticides, no hormones and no synthetic ingredients are contained in them. It is important to me to eat foods that are grown as naturally as possible. More and more people are trending toward organic food consumption. 

I am not opposed to genetically engineered foods, per se, for reasons of increased flavor or pest resistance, or shelf life. But they must be grown in natural ways- ways supported by current organic definitions. I will continue to choose not to consume meat from animals treated with hormones, antibiotics, parasiticides and other subtherapeutic treatments. 

I make invaluable use of current nutrition labels on food packages, as do MANY people I know. I compare nutritional values of carbohydrate, protein and fat content, as well as the types and quantities of preservatives and artifial ingredients. This information CANNOT be compromised. IF this rule passes, there must be specific labelling on all "organic" foods that I can trust! IF this rule passes, I DEMAND that food will be labelled very specifically with ingredient lists, INCLUDING any non-organic substances used in the growth or harvest or processing.

There are many man-made "improvements" in use with agriculture, but the many of these improvements are not sufficiently tested, and many have been shown to decrease the quality of human life. PLEASE do not take away my choice as a consumer to use the kind of food I want.
