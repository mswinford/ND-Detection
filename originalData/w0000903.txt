comment = We have been living with and using organic products for the past 20 
odd years under the CCOF standard here in California. 

During this time farmers, distributors, and suppiers have built a
level of trust that we feel is being undermined by 
the general tenor of some of the proposed inclusions:
specifically, toxic/sewer waste sludge as fertilizer, biogenet-
ically engineered products, and use of synthetic pesticides.

CCOF is a standard recognized around the world for health and integrity.
Perhaps USDA could use some of that. Proposed standards that deviate 
too drastically from the CAlifornia model will undermine the good will people
have come to expect. 

USDA, get with the program.
