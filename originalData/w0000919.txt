comment = Why is the federal government requiring fees that range in the hundreds of dollars? Most state certification fees are low--around $10. The most expensive is a private internation agency and that is around $250 (which is expected because they need to cover higher costs). What is the government's excuse? Fees as high as the ones proposed here strongly suggests that the hand of big business is stirring things up and influencing your judgement. High fees all but eliminate the small farmer and grower, the very people which make up the majority of organic producers. Get in touch with the people and listen to them carefully.
