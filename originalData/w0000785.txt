comment = I do not feel that irradiation or genetic engineering belong in organic production or processing systems. In addition, I oppose the use of sewage sludge. Although this is a potentially valuable organic fertilizer, sewage sludge often contains toxic heavy metals and other contaminants that accumulate in the soil. Until scientific technology devises a way to rid sludge of these dangerous metals, I cannot endorse the use of sewage sludge on soils used to produce organic foods ... and neither should the USDA.
