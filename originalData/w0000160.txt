comment = The language in this section is wholly unacceptable as it stands, as it leaves open the significant possibility for seeds and planting stock of non-organic origin to be labeled and sold as organic. Specifically, section 205.8 should be amended as follows for the reasons stated below:

§ 205.8 Selection and use of seeds, seedlings and planting stock.
(a) Organically produced seeds and planting stock, including annual seedlings and transplants, shall ALWAYS be used. (**DELETE REMAINDER**).

**************************************************************************

NOTE: the inclusion of provisions whereby non-organically produced seeds or planting stock may be used in organic production fundamentally undermines the integrity of the program. It permits non-organic seeds and planting stock to be used if organic seed and planting stock are not "commercially available". The definition of the term, "commercially available", leaves ample room for subjective interpretation. It states that seed, etc must be in an "appropriate form, quality, AND quantity to be feasibly AND economically used to fulfill an essential function". In addition to the compounded set of qualifications required by the use of "and", the words "appropriate", "quality", "feasibly and economically" can be construed in many ways according to one's particular purpose. 

I believe that the average consumer can accept that a certain organic crop or food may be unavailable -- particularly if the reason is that the seeds or planting stock to produce is are unavailable. Most consumers would enormously prefer knowing this to the uncertainty that the food they select with an organic label may in fact not be because someone (probably for commercial reasons) decided that organic seed/planting stock was not "commercially available".

The bottom line is -- commercial interests should not dictate what is right. Only organic foods should be sold as such.
