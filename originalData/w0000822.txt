comment = I and my family strongly oppose the labeling of genetically altered food as organic. It is bad enough that consumers are forced to pay premium prices to ensure our food is safe from pesticides, hormones and other dangers; the proposed standards would now hoodwink consumers into paying premium prices for products they believe are safe and organic which may be neither.

It is time for our government to protect the consumer rather than the profits of the biochemical engineering industry. Consumers have always had the basic right to know the ingredients in their food. These proposed standards would bypass that right.
