comment = I could not find any mention of irradiation as an allowed or disallowed procedure. It is important to disallow irradiation. Not only does it promote a false sense of security regarding bacteria (perhaps encouraging people to not use safe handling practices), but it is an issue of concern as we do not know the long term effects of eating foods that have been exposed to radiation. Buying organic foods is a way of ensuring that what you eat is natural. Introducing irradiation violates this goal.
