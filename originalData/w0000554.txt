After reading some current liturature on this issue; I am greatly disturbed. The additional federal organic regulation is not
even more strict than 'laid back' California's? Allowing process' such as radiation, toxic pesticides and treated sewage water
be used in 'Organic' farming? Perhaps a new certification could be used and issued by the usda 'semi-organic' or
'kinda-sorta organic' or even 'not quite organic' or perhaps 'USDA ORGANIC'. My feelings are that if the USDA is going to regulate this process than learn from the ones that have worked continually. The California Organic Food Act of 1990 is a
fine example.
