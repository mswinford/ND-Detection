comment = Apparently, the proposed rules do not explicitly prohibit: genetically 
engineered foods and chemicals, irradiated food, the use of sewage based 
fertilizer (has problems with heavy metals), and allows the Agriculture 
Secretary to add synthetic or genetically engineered chemicals that could be used to grow "organic" food. It is unbelievable to me that this would be allowed. If this rule passes I will no longer buy organic foods.
