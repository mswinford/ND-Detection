comment = I am very appreciative of being able to buy produce that I trust to be held to the highest organic (natural as possible) standards. 

My concern about processing being allowed to be used for organic produce is that there is no prohibition against nuclear irradiation. Whether or not this is safe is not my argument. There are many people who simply do not wish to eat food that has been irradiated. It seems most reasonable to give these people a choice by prohibiting organic foods from irradiation. People who buy organic foods are usually willing to pay more for the quality of the food and of the processing, therefore other methods should be used and charged for. Many organic producers currently have methods in place that produce safe, high quality produce without irradiation. Please add this prohibition to the rules so that I can continue to trust that this is the case.

Thank you for your consideration. Please, PLEASE do not allow organic produce to become questionable to many of us. This will destroy the budding organic food industry. Most people who are willing to pay more for 
organic produce do so because they can trust it--and most of those people that I know do not want their food irradiated. I, personally, will not be willing to pay extra for food that I do not trust.
