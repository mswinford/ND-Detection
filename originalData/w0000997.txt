comment = TO THE PARTIES ENTERTAINING THE IDEA OF SEWAGE SLUDGE AS "ALLOWABLE " IN APPLICATIONS ON ORGANIC FARMS! Please reconsider the notion of using human waste products as acceptable practice on organic farmland. While it may seem to be a great way to recycle, this idea is dangerous to the end users( namely those who choose to eat organically raised produce) for obvious reasons. The many heavy metals and contaminants found in human waste are not harmless. They can be used solely for ornamental purposes where they will not be ingested but need to stay out of the area of food production. Thank you for allowing a format to state my concerns. Sincerely, Mark Freer
