comment = I am strongly opposed to the inclusion of genetically engineered foods as part of the "organic" definition, the irradiation of organically grown foods and the use of bio-solids and sewage sludge in cultivation of organic foods. As a consumer, I want to have a choice about what I put into my body, and if some organic foods are cultivated and handled differently from others, I will be unable to tell. The purpose of this rule seems to be standardization of organic foods, but if some foods are not "completely" organic (using my definition), then the rule is worthless to me. The rule as it is written now, may even make it harder for me to determine which foods are truly organic.

Thank you.
