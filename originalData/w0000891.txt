comment = If the current strict standards for growing organic foods are decreased, improper labelling will mislead those consumers (like me) wishing to consume only truly organic foods. Any ingredients not currently considered organic must be properly labelled on organic foods if they will appear on the National List of Ingredients if the proposal passes.

If the standards are decreased, consumers must be allowed to know exaclty what they are buying! This means strict labelling must be enforced. Any synthetic, subtherapeutic, parasiticidal, pesticidal, etc., ingredients used if the proposal passes MUST be clearly labelled (even as "warning") on "organic" foods containing them.

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE
LISTEN TO US, THE CONSUMERS!!!
