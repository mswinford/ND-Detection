ORGANIC CONSUMERS AND PRODUCERS ARE A MINISCULE PART OF FOOD BUSINEE.AT BEST I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE US ALONE, LET US WORK OUT OUR OWN RULE NEEDS. AT WORST PLEASE LET THE STATES BE THE LAST RESORT. I DO NOT WANT OR TRUST ADM AND ITS ILK. HEALTHY CHOICE BRAND? IT IS TO LAUGH. THE REAL ANSWER IS A WELL INFORMED CONSUMER, YOU HAVE BEEN WHALING AWAY AT THAT AND I BELIVE ON BALANCE YOU HAVE GONE BACKWARD. IF ONE OF YOU BRIGHT BUREAUCRATS REPLY THAT THE TYSONS, THE ADMS ET AL HAVE A RIGHT TO POLUTE THIS LAST LITTLE ISLAND OF PURE FOOD, I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED.//// WE ALREADY HAVE AN EFFICIENT PROCTOR FOR ORGANICS. THE ORGANIC GROCERS SUCH AS WILD OATS AND OTHERS. PLEASE, PLEASE DO NOT PROTECT US FROM OURSELVES ITS NOT BROKE FOLKS
