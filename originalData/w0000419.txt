comment = As a long time consumer of organic foods I am heartened by the USDA's intention to begin regulating the industry. It is imperative for the credibility and growth of the industry that consumers be assured of the safety and "purety" of the foods they purchase which are labelled "organic." Therefore, controversial or suspect substances or processes must not be permitted under the organic certification umbrella. The certification process must be safeguarded against such assaults on its credibility, especially at the very inception of the certification process. Producers of organic foods will for some time be charging a premium for their goods and their survival will in part be predicated on consumers' trust in the purety of the food that they are paying this premium for. By allowing genetically engineered products, irradiated products and products grown with sewage sludge under the organic certification umbrella, the USDA would be undermining the very goal it is aiming to achieve with its inteded regulatory process. As a long time consumer of organic foods, someone who has voluntarily spent thousands of dollars more on food to ensure its freedom from artifical and synthetic contaminants, I implore you to maintain the credibility of an industry that is fast becoming a vital one, both economically and medically.

Thank you for accepting my comments, and thank you for undertaking this regulatory challenge!

Sincerely,

David Lisak
