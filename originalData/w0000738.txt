To Whom It May Concern:
 As a consumer and a retailer, I have significant concerns about the lack of detail in the proposed rule in relation to genetically engineered organisms (GEOs). I have always considered organically grown foods the last bastion of the natural foods industry where you are truly getting what you expect--a totally unadulterated, natural (in the most real sense) product.
 Although I am open to being honestly educated about technological "advancements", I believe that we all need to take a very close look at the possible environmental and health ramifications of allowing GEOs into our world's food supply at all, much less dilute the purity of organically grown foods.
 The growing number of consumers who shop in natural food stores demand that we provide them with environmentally appropriate, health sustaining products. We cannot do so if there is no consideration given to the GEO controversy in this proposal.
 If this issue is not addressed here, I fear that it will not be given the attention it deserves in any venue. Please don't let pass the opportunity to safeguard at least one source of non-mutated sustenance. It's not just a good idea--it's the right thing to do.

Thank you for your attention.
Michelle Walker
