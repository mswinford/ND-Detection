comment = I think it's great that there will be standards for the organic food 
industry. Consumer's will have greater confidence that they are getting
what they are paying for. My concern though is that these new standards
will allow irradiated or genetically altered food to be called organic.
One of the reasons I buy organic is to avoid these kinds of foods. One
of the reasons I avoid irradiated food is that the government does not
want to label such foods. I should be able to choose whether to consume
this kind of product myself. The food companies know that a great percentage of the public may not buy irradiated food if it was labeled as such. As far as sewage-sludge "YUCK!!". 

If the new standards allow the above or anything else that is added to 
the product (anti-biotics, hormones etc. ) I will be forced to look
for products which state that they dont use the above practices.
