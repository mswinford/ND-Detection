comment = A proposal outlining new Federal Organic Standards was announced today.
This proposal would replace the current California Organic foods 
certification used across the country.

This "New Improved" National Organic Standard would permit food
grown from Genetically Engineered seed, treated with Irradiation,
or fertilized with "Sewage" to receive a label stating that it was
"Organically Grown".

This is compounded with the fact that the existing stricter California
Organic Standard would most likely no longer be permitted.

As a consumer, I strongly oppose this Federal standard proposal.
