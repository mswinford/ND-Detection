comment = It is very important that organic certification have real meaning in the public marketplace. If organic production methods include irradiation, genetic engineering or the use of sewage sludge the public will have little faith in the labeling and certification programs. These methods may have their place but not in the "certified organic" arena. These method are the very thing most consumers are trying to avoid when looking for the "organic" label. Please do not dilute the strength, at least in the eyes of the consumer, or the words "organically grown or produced". This is an opportunity to provide a choice for the American consumer in our agricultural system. Allowing these methods will force the consumer to work harder and look beyond labeling and certification programs in order to find what they want. 

Please do not allow irradiation, genetic engineering or sewage sludge to become part of the "organic standards". It would be a disservice to the American public.

Sincerely, Leila Nabors
