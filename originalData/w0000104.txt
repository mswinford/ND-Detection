comment = I am very dissapointed to here that the following products may be labeled as organic: 

1) products genetically altered via biotechnology, 
2) irradiated products,
3) products fertilized with or grown in sludge, or reprocessed sewage. 

I cetainly don't want to eat these types of products much less pay a premium for them.
