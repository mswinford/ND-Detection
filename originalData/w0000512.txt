comment = I understand that consideration is being given to watering down what is required to be considered Organic. Meaning that 'Organic' growers/farmers will be allowed to use chemical pesticides, and other cheaper means of producing. In my view that is a very bad idea. Now the organic food I buy is high in quality and at a mostly reasonable price. Anything that you do to allow 'agri-business' to mess that up will not be appreciated. That (and the food supplement industry) need to be encouraged. I feel strongly enough about this that what my local, state, and national representatives do on these issues and largely determine my future voting decisions.
