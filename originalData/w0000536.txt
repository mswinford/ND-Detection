comment = Allowing genetically engineered foods will render the label "Certified
Organic" essentially meaningless. If this were to happen, hopefully
another group will define a truly "organic" definition, and this 
would be the only organic label that would mean anything to me.

Genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term 
effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not 
want to consume them. Not only are the long term effects untested, but
the idea of genetic engineering goes against the very spirit of
organic farming methods. 

I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such 
so that I can choose not to consume them in any form. Its cruel to 
lead people to believe that they are eating safe food when in fact
the safety of the food is unknown, and people eating the food are
unknowingly and without their permission being forced to participate
in what is essentially a massive experiment.
