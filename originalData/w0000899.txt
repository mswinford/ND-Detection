Thank you for the opurtunity to speak on this very important issue. I believe that it would be criminal to allow the use of non-organic materials, devices, or procedures to be used in the name of organic food. This proposal is soley designed to help AGRO business be able to join in on a newly devoloping market. The avg. american uses the organic not to mean only 80% of feed has to be organic or that irradiation is being used on our foods. The proposal is misleading. Large businesses that want to be in the organic market will have to wait to sell their products until they can meet the standards set by real organic growers of america. I wish I had more time to completely define all of the points that aI have tried to make but please do not ruin a great idea.

Thank You,
