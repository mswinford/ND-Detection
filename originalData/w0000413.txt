comment = Well, I just have to say that if what I have heard about this rule is true, then it will fail and fail hugely.

There is now way anyone can do this and get away with this. It is a vile and evil rule and those who support it are either crazy or getting money for it.

Or worse.

I can in no way support this heinous, Nazi legislation and will it to fail miserably utterly and quickly.

Go down now.
