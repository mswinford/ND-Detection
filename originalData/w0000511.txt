comment = To Whom It May Concern,
I have several areas of concern about this bill. First, I feel it should 
be designed for the benefit of the consumer, not for the benefit of large
agribusiness trying to horn in on the honest profits of those already in
the production of organic products. This means making the law more strict
when it comes to what is allowed in the production of food, not less. So
I oppose allowing irradiated food to be labeled "organic",(I find the very
idea repugnant!) I also oppose allowing "sewage sludge" to be used in the
production of any food,let alone any food stuff labeled "organic". Who are
these people who would propose such a thing anyway! Probably somebody with 
alot of sh_t, I mean sludge, on their hands and are trying not just to get rid of it, but to actually make a profit on it. And finally, I oppose 
labeling genetically altered or engineered foodstuffs "organic". I beleive
that there is such a thing as the "spirit of the law". I think that when
most people think of organic they are thinking of something that is "of 
nature",something that has been grown without synthetics and artificiall
stimulation. I think allowing any of the above practices violates that spirit.
 I do realize that not everybody feels the same way, which brings up the idea, why not let growers do what ever they please as long as they clearly label their products as to how they have been produced. If some grower of vegetables whants to label his product "Genetically altered squash from Monsanto Miracle seed fertilized with sewage sludge from the Los Angeles Hyperion Plant and irradiated but otherwise "organic", let `em.
Let the market place decide!
