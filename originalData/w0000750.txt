comment = The NOP could be a real boom to improving the food supply and making organic foods much more available than in the past..However, I am amazed that part of the definition "organic" includes the use of and regulation of irradiated and genetically engineered foods. this is certainly not my definition of anything organic and natural..also that foods can be grown on sewer sludge which is loaded with pesticide residues and that these foods could be considered "organic" for the health of our planet and gene pool these substances must not be part of this national certifying process. 

thank you for the opportunity to comment..Karen Jones
