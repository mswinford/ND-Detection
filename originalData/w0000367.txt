comment = Crops treated with sewage sludge should not be accorded the
"organic" label. The levels of heavy metals present in these
sludges are too high.

I also oppose the use of the term "organic" to cover genetically
engineered foods and irradiated foods. We do not yet know the
consequences of using these technologies in food production, but
on past experience it is likely that there will be unforseen
negative consequences that will cause us to limit, focus or ban
the use of these technologies.
