comment = VITAMINS ARE DAMAGED BY IRRADIATION.ESSENTTIAL POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS ARE ALSO DAMAGED.NUTRITIONAL WELLNESS OF THE COMPLETE FOOD MOLECULE IS BROKEN. THE MOST BASIC PART OF LIFE, CHROMOSOMES, ARE BEING PUT AT RISK. IN A HUMAN VOLUNTEER STUDY IN 1984, 70 VOLUNTEERS WHO CONSUMED A WHOLE DIET CONSISTING OF 35 IRRADIATED FOODS FOR A PEROID OF 90 DAYS DEVELOPED POLYPLOIDY,A DEFECT IN THE CHROMOSOMES OF BLOOD CELLS. POLYPLOIDY WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN A STUDY ON FEEDING FRESHLY IRRADIATED WHEAT TO MALNOURISHED CHILDREN,CONDUCTED BY THE NIN AT THE CMRI.CHILDREN IN A CONTROL GROUP ,FED A SIMILAR BUT UNIRRADIATED DIET SHOWED NO POLYPLOIDY.BOTH PRIMATES AND OTHER ANIMAL STUDIES HAVE PROVEN THE SAME RESULT. THE CONCERN IS UNDENIABLE. POLYPLOIDY IS A HEALTH ISSUE. WE ALL HAVE 46 CHROMOSOMES, WHICH CONTAIN THE BLUPRINT FOR THE CELLS FUNCTIONS.DAMAGE TO THE CHROMOSOMES CAN CAUSE THE CELL TO MALFUNTION.WITH POLYPLOIDY,THERE IS AN EXTRA SET OF CHROMOSOMES.AS POLYPLOIDYIS IS VERY RARE IN HUMAN CELLS AND IS FREQUENTLY OBSERVED IN TUMOR CELLS,IT IS CLEAR THAT A CAUTIOUS APPROACH MUST BE ADOPTED.WHY THEN IS THE USDA PLAYING LOOSE WITH ORGANIC STANDARDS AND IRRADIATION? I ASK YOU TO ASK ENRIQUE FIGUROA OF THE USDA MARKETING DIVISION NOW. HE CAN BE CONTACTED AT THIS WEBSITE AND HIS POSITION OF AUTHORITY ALLOWS HIM TO RESPOND TRUTHFULLY.CONTACT HIM IMMEADATELY.IRRADIATED FOOD IS MUTAGENIC? ASK HIM! PLEASE ASK HIM...IMMEADATELY TODAY.
IRRADIATION CONTRIBUTES TO FREE RADICALS BEING FORMED AT THE MOST BASIC LEVELS IN THE BODY?FREE RADICALS ARE CARCENOGENIC?IRRADIATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO LOWER IMMUNE RESPONCE?IRRADIATED FOOD IS NUTRISHONALLY EMPTY? HOW THE HELL COME THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE AND DAN GLICKMAN AND ENRIQUE FIGUROA WANT TO ASSOCIATE ORGANIC AND IRRADIATED ON THE SAME LABLE?
 HERES WHY. 1%OF THE FOOD DOLLAR PURCHISHES IN AMERICA IS\ARE DIRECTED AT ORGANIC CHOICES.CORPORATE AGRIBUSINESS HAS LOBBIED IN WASHINGTON D.C. TO STOP THIS 1%. THEY HATE THE ORGANIC CONSUMER.IN CLOSED DOOR MEETINGS THE ORGANIC CONSUMER AND GROWER ARE INTENTIONALLY CASTIGATED.MADE OUT TO BE HIPPIES, PINKOS, MEATHATERS,PEOPLE WHO THINK THEIR BETTER THAN OTHERS,FOLKS THAT NEED A LESSON AND TO BE BROUGHT DOWN. CORPORATE AGBUS. HAS INFECTED THE FOOD SYSTEM IN AMERICA TO THE POINT OF DISASTER.SOIL ERROSION ALONE POINTS TO THE DASTERARDLY DEEDS OF CONVENTIONAL CORPORATE FARMING.BILLONS OF TONS OF TOP SOIL WASHED DOWN RIVERS AND STREAMS YEARLY.POISIONING FOOD AT EVERY BIOLOGICAL HIGH POINT,FROM PRE SEED TO PURCHASE.AND DENYING AND DEFYING THE PUBLIC TO CATCH UM [CORPORATE AGBUS.]AT IT.
 AS OF 12\15\97 GLICKMAN AND FIGUROA ARE PART OF IT.THESE ORGANIC STANDARDS ARE WRITTEN BY THE USDA IN AN OUTRIGHT ATTEMPT TO CONFUSE THE PUBLIC.THE DOCUMENT AS WRITTEN IS CRIMINAL.
 
 I CALL ON THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO INVESTIGATE THIS CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR AND TO BRING TO COURT THOSE INDIVIDUALS AND PARTYS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TOPUT IRRADIATED AND ORGNIC TOGETHER. THIS IS FRAUD. MGORMANWATERPOB41CHASEBURGWI546216084832132
