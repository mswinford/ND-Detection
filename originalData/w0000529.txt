Our group represents several thousand people who are using natural and alternative means for health practices and healing. Key in our practices is the use of fresh, organic vegetarian food. We strongly object to any genetically engineered vegetables or food being labeled as "organic" until it can be determined that there are no long-term health consequences from eating such food.
