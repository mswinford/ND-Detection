comment = Please allow the consumer to make our own informed decisions about the food we eat. Please keep "organic"...organic. Natural. Nothing artificial/chemical/toxic added.

Irradiation is not natural. Please allow us the choice.

And most importantly, genetically engineered foods are not even close to being natural. Added fish genes? What if your guest is allergic to fish? Who would think about asking if your tomatoes contain fish?

Please...keep the high standards for the word "organic".
