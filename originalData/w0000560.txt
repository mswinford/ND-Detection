comment = Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of
genetic engineering to be used in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human
health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
Genetic engineering also provides serious potential hazards to those 
with food allergies and sensitivities. I would like to see all genetically
engineered foods labeled as such so that I can choose not to consume
them in any form.

 Sincerely, 
 Ariel Reinheimer
