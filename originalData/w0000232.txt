comment = I am opposed to genetically engineered seeds
or any other aspect of genetic engineering being used
in organic production. Because genetically
engineered foods have not been tested for their
long-term effects on human health, on animals,
or on the environment, I do not want to consume them.
In fact, I would like to see all genetically engineered
foods labelled as such so that I can choose not
to consume them in any form.
