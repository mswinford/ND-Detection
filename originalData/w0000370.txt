I ask that you not allow genetically engineered seeds or produce to 
be used in organic production. Why bother even having an organic 
designation if you do this? Genetically _engineered foods_ are just that: 
_engineered foods_, and are in no sense organic. They also have not been 
tested for their long-term effects on human health, animal health, or the 
environment, and I personally have not and will not consume them. In fact, 
I want all genetically engineered foods to be labelled so that I 
don't have to waste my time determining which foods are and are not.
