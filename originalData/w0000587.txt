comment = As many other citizens agree on, it is in my opinion a very uncomfortable thought to
use the organic label as a vehicle for
distributing genetically altered produce
over the counter. Then all the honest
and caring small farmers are going to have to
use another word instead of "organic", like
for eksampel, "produce as god intended"
or "natures own" It is allready a fact that
many people would like to pay a little more
to be safe from the ongoing price wars of
the big supermarkets. It is a fact that many
people cherish the lifestyle of "quality vs.
quantity" And as I have experienced myself,
organic produce is better tasting, and it makes
me feel like I have a choice against progressive
efforts, that in the end only shows to be like
a jack in the box towards future generations,
