The Program will require all producers, growers, distributors, and retailers of genetically engineered food products, vitamins, good supplements, or other items for human consumption to clearly label them as having been genetically engineered, when offering them for sale and/or for consumption by the general public. Labeling must be on every package or visible to the end user or consumer, and must state "Genetically Engineered Product". Genetically Engineered food products cannot be labeled "organic" or sold as organic food.
