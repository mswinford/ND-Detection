comment = Genetically engineered food products should not be considered organic. As a researcher in biology and medicine, it is obvious to me that the long-term health consequences of genetically-engineered food are inadequately researched and understood. In any case, it will be decades before many potential effects could surface and become evident. Therefore organically engineered food exposes the user to unknown health risks. Since many people turn to organic food to avoid the uncertain and unknown health risks of non-organic food, calling genetically engineered food "organic" completely undermines the purpose and ideal of organic food production. Please don't do it.
