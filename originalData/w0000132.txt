comment = The fee and rules proposed will exclude many small producers from the market. The rules proposed will allow known carcinogens derived from plant or animal sources to be used. This all is a big sham by the large agribuisness lobby to muscle their way into the miniscule organic market. People who see thru your smoke and mirrors will not trust the label with USDA approved Organic.
