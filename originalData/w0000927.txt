comment = To whom it may concern:

I understand that the USDA is considering allowing the use of irradiation, sewage sludge, and biological engineering on organic foods. As a consumer who regularly buys organic foods, I can tell you that I would never consider such processes as organic. In fact, one of the advantages as I see it, to buying organic produce is that I know more about how the food was produced. Namely, I know that it wasn't biologically engineered, it wasn't grown with sewage, and it hasn't been irradiated. If the USDA were to allow these processes, it would make little sense to even have an organic designation.

I also have heard that there is a conflict over whether the regulation determining 'organic-ness' should come from the state the food is grown in or the USDA. If this conflict exists, the more stringent rule should apply.

Thank you,
Robert Abiad
