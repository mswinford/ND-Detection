comment = Hello USDA,
 I would like to register a loud "Nay" to the proposed organic food rules, based on (at least) three main objections.

 Allowing irradiated food to be called organic is preposterous and dangerously misleading to consumers.
 Calling food organic which has been gentically engineered is fraudulent and deceptive.
 Allowing food which is grown with treated waste byproducts like sewer sludge to be called organic is simply nonsensical and contradictory.

Please remove these three allowances from the proposed rules. Please make them more like California's rules, which work well here. If they work for our consumers, they will work for the rest of the country as well.

Chase Williams
