comment = Firstly, I commend the regulatory agency for taking this step.
I have been an organic home grower for 10 years now. I have also been for
the past 5 years an active proponent for purchasing organic food. I drive 
20 miles to a grocery store (once every 2 - 3 weeks) to purchase my groceries
at a store commited to organics in every form (dry, fresh, canned and 
prepared). I do this for the health of my family as well as the planet. 
I applaud your efforts except the following:
 Irraditation - I do not feel that irradiated foods should come under the
 organic label. Irradiation is NOT organic.
 Genetic Engineered foods: again genetic engineering is not organic.
 many genetic engineered foods include herbicides such as Roundup etc.
 Roundup can not be considered organic and I do not wish to feed my
 child roundup in his bowl of cereal.
 Lastly, although sewage sludge can be a valuable fertilizer it often 
 contains heavy metals and contaminates that can build up in the soil.
I go out of my way to feed my family and young son the healthest food 
available. When I feed my family organic food (which is about 80%) I feel
good knowing I'm doing my part to keep them and the planet healthy. Please,
allow me and others continued satisafaction and safety in eating organic
foods. Please do your part in keeping Roundup, toxins, and radiation
out of our meals.
