We are about to face regulations that define the food we eat. This is significant because, by my way of thinking, what will be called "Organic" in the future may not be as high a standard as we now enjoy. True, today's standard is mixed (because of all of the conflicting labellers), but at least in California, we can shop (and eat) with confidence. 

Specifically, my wife and I buy organic foods because we DON'T want petro-chemicals, sewage, growth hormones, soaps, acids, oils, antibiotics, biotech pesticides, or irradiation in our diets. My household purchases organic foods now to avoid them. If these non-food items and processes are to become part of what is considered "Organic," I don't know what the alternative will be. 

I believe that the environmental benefits of drastically reducing or eliminating synthetic pesticides and fertilizers are significant, though I am not well enough versed in that area to be more specific. By encouraging agribusiness to adopt more demanding/stringent requirements to enter the "Organic" market, they will become familiar with methodologies that don't rely upon non-edibles and poisons (that may be passed on to and consumed by the buyer).

I also think that it is important to differentiate between free-range livestock and "factory-direct-to-you" animals that have been loaded up with anti-biotics, deprived of exercise and natural light, and stressed out in over-crowded environments. I feel strongly that we should be able to distinguish between these two types of livestock food.
