comment = Please do not allow the introduction of genetically engineered seeds or any other genetically engineered products into the organic food supply, because genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment. I would like all genetically engineered foods labeled as such so that I can choose not to consume them.
