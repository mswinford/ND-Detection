comment = I am furious about the idea of allowing genetically engineered foods to be labeled or categorized as "organic"!! You know and I know that this whole gen eng food thing all goes back to money for the corporation (Monsanto) and no regard for the health and safety and PREFERENCES of the people of this country. Labeling these foods, which are not known to be harmless, as "organic" must not occur. There is a huge group of people who prefer natural foods and buying organic is the only option if you are going to allow our other food to be polluted AND not labeled. I think if you have any regard at all for the masses you will choose either to label the gen eng foods as such, so that we know what we are buying, or ban them altogether (my preference). It is not ethical, in my estimation, to both not require labeling of these foods and also putting them into the category of "organic". You are trying to keep us blind because you are afraid that if we are given the choice, we will choose organic and you will not make the money back on this preposterous venture. This is an outrage!
