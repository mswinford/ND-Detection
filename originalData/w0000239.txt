Dear USDA,


As a medical doctor, and scientist I am appalled at the rapid proliferation of unchecked genetically engineered substances into our food supply and environment.

There is no long term research on the release of genetically engineered organisms into the food supply, or the environment. Right now most of the processed food in the US has a possiblility of containing genetically engineered oils, or other substances. We are playing russian roulet with grave consequences for the health and well-being of our citizens.

Once genetically engineered substances are released into the environment they cannot be recalled. Certainly millions of years of evolution has brought about a delicately balanced ecology, and we don't seem to be the slightest bit concerned that corporations whose primary motivation is making money, are rapidly releasing these organisms into our environment and food supply.

It is absolutely essential that organic food remains free from genetically engineered substances of any kind. No food with an organic label should contain any percentage, no matter how smal, l of genetically engineered material. 

Please, listen to your conscience instead of these big powerful lobbies, the health and well being of all the future generations should not be left to chance.

Sincerely 

Dr. Michael Busch
