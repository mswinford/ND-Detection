comment = I am particularly concerned that genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering are allowed to be used in organic production. Genetically engineered foods have not been tested for their long-term effects on human health, on animals, or on the environment, I do not wish to consume them. Currently organicly produce foods are my one assured option to genetically engineered foods. In fact producers of genetically modified items have claimed that there is no difference, and that if a consumer wishes to have a difference they should choose organice produce which is labled as such. If genentically engineered elements are introduced and accepted in organice practices then there will no longer be a consumer choice. 

I would like to see all genetically engineered foods labelled as such so that I can choose not to consume them in any form.
