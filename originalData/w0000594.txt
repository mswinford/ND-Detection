comment = Section 205.7 / Section 205.23 should prohibit municipal sewer sludge or biosolids containing any
heavy metals, chemical solvents, or any other synthetic
substances suspected to have adverse health effects, i.e. the sludge is purely animal
digestive waste matter. Burden of proof that the sludge does not contain such
substances falls upon the farmers or business desiring to use the sludge and
must be proven before the produce can be labeled organic. Such sludge use must include
erosion controls to avoid disease outbreaks like the Pfisteria outbreaks in
Maryland and North Carolina.
