Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I do not like the idea of including irradiation techniques or sludge (which might contain toxics, chemicals) in the definition of organic. I am confused as to why these might be considered "organic". I regularly buy organic produce and would be most unhappy to learn that these tecniques were being used to produce the produce (so to speak) that I pay so much more for. Perhaps I am already foolish? In any case, thank you for working on this important issue. (I wish I was better able to understand the rule! But I think you get the gist of my comments)

Sincerely,

Caryn Brooks
