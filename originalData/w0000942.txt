comment = I have not yet read fully all of the information about certification because I was interested in becoming a certification agent. However, after reading the costs involved in that I have some serious reservations. I think the fees are excessive. It seems to me that those already classified as certifying agents have lobbied to make it almost impossible for others to become involved it that aspect of the program. As the growth of organic farming increases, the demand for certifying agents will also increase, especially here in Florida. Currently, we have just a handful of agents to cover the whole state. More are needed. However, this might have a negative economic effect on the current agents who do not want competition. Right now, it would be hard to justify investing several thousand dollars to become certified. If the fees were reduced, more certifying agents would be available to certify organic production operations. One of the draw backs to becoming a certified organic grower is the cost of the certification. There are many good intentioned people who believe in the program, but are not able to afford $ 500 a year for certification. This fee is set by the certifying agent. If the potential organic producer does not want to pay that fee, he can go elsewhere. Unfortuneatel, there is no " elsewhere". If this were a manufacturing operation, one could almost use words like collusion, anti-trust, monopoly.... Please reconsider thes exhorbitant fees to become acertifying agent.
