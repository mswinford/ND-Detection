I am a vegan. I do not want any kind of genetically engineered products in my food. I want to keep my food pure vegetarian. With genetically engineered food no telling what genes from what animal will be in there. We have no idea what the long term ramifications are of mixing animal genes into vegetarians. It frightens me. I want PURE FOOD. PURE FOOD. We must consider people's allergies to certain products in food also. If I am allergic to salami, for instance, and engineered food product from salami are put into my vegetarian food, I could get deathly sick. PLEASE DON't FOOL WITH OUR FOOD SYSTEM!!!
