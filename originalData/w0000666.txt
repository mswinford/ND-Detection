I am in favor of federal standards for certification of organic products as long as the program works like the smog standards: federal standards
are the minimum acceptable requirements for such certification/labeling and any state or private certifier may develop and certify to more
stringent standards, as is the case with federal and California smog standards. No other scheme give me adequate information for my
food purchasing information needs.
