Please do not allow genetically engineered seeds or any other aspect of genetic engineering to be used in organic crop production. As of yet, we do not know what types of affects this would have on our environment or our health. To genetically alter something is to no longer allow it to be in its natural state. Foods in their natural state is what consumers who purchase organic foods are looking for.

Thank you.
