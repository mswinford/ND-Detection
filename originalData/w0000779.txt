comment = As a consumer I would like to state that I don't believe that irradiation and/or genetic engineering is an organic practice. I feel very strongly that these two items should be banned from being labeled organic. As a consumer I choose not to eat food that has been irradiated or engineered and it is impossible to tell the difference if the label is simply "organic". It is very important that the specifics of organic labeling be clear cut and concise.

Secondly using often highly toxic sewage sludge is not now and never will be an organic practice. You are merely trying to fool yourself if you label foods grown in sludge "organic."

I am delighted that the Federal government has at long last declared the value of organics.
