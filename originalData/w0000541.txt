comment = Sirs, information is the purist way to empower consumers like myself. If a product for sale cannot handle "informational statements" about itself,then maybe the product is not ready for market. The "statement" on a product is as close to a warranty/guarantee on it. I find the "Nutrition Facts" statements on products most useful & could use more to make the best available decision.I cannot see the plus to consumers by prohibiting the one tool available to us--FACTS.
