comment = Irradiation should never be allowed. It is forcing everyone to consume neuclar waste. Our bodies cannot tollerate such treatment. New and deadly ailments will arise if people are forced to accept irratiated foods. It scares me, when I think of my children and grand children being forced to purchase any food that is supposed to give them life, but instead will ultimately cause their death.
