comment = Organic foods can be even more subject to deseases than crops nurtured with chemical fertilizers. There has been much talk of irradiating food but there must be a more natural metheod i.e. ozon treatment as in europe that does not leave any residue or change the composition in any way. It does not apply, but I have received so much radiation myself,both from cancer treatments and several angiograms that the sheets flash blue when I roll over in bed. I!m not fooling though it probably from static electricity. The point is, I don!t want any food organic or otherwise if it has to be irradiated to be considered safe under any government rule. Sincerely, John J Donovan
