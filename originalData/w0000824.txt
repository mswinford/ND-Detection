comment = I welcome a federal standard for Organic food. As a consumer it is part of accurate food labeling. I currently buy food that is CCOF (California Certified Organic Farmers) certified. I buy organic produce and milk.

I like the stringency of CCOF and would like to see the Federal program adopt the same standards. The term 'Organic' is most useful when it is a stringent measure. Allowing irradiation, genetically engineered crops, human sewage use, etc. weaken the value of the term. I would continue to rely on CCOF certification if such concerns are not addressed by the federal standard. I also think that allowing milk to be labelled as organic when only 80% of the feed is organic is too lax. The term 'Organic' must be meaningful or it will serve no purpose. I understand that it is difficult for some farmers to meet stringent standards--they will just have to rely on uncertified labelling to sell their product.
