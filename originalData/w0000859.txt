comment = The term Organic Food loeses all meaning if not considered from the point of view of the consumer. As a consumer, I would not want organic-labelled food produced with sewage sludge. Additionally, it is imperitive to maintain the strictest prohibitions against chemical/pesticide/herbicide contamination -- as this is an extremely important issue for many organic produce consumers. 

Genetically engineered or irradiated food of ANY sort should be labelled as such -- this is not just an organic food issue. Also, the government should ensure that consumers have access to foodstuffs not produced through genetic engineering or that use irratiation.

On another note: The government should not be in the business of handing out money to organic farmers whose lands have become contaminated by accidental pesticide/chemical drift. Ultimately, the offender must pay for such damage -- if someone drives through my front yard, I expect them to pay for any damage. If the government want to enact legislation to enable the retribution process for the organic farmer, that's OK by me.

One last point: A multitiered organic standard would probably be effective in managing the costs associated with organic farming -- USDA grade A organic would be produced to a stricter standard that USDA grade B organic, etc.

Thank You,
