I strongly disagree with ANY allowance for the use of synthetic chemicals, genetic engineering, biotechnology, irridation, and hazardous sewage sludge in the production of "organic"-certified foods. 

One purpose for an national organic standard should be to give present and future consumers of organic foods the certainty and peace of mind that the food they eat is raised in a sustainable, non-destructive manner.

In addition, a national organic standard must represent farming and food production methods that are not at odds with nature. 

If the USDA organic standard includes these any of these NON-ORGANIC provisions, it is a FAILURE to the AMERICAN PEOPLE and a sad testimony to the power of giant agribusiness to control government policy. 

Please come to your senses, support the general welfare of our people, our land, and environment. Say no to corporate greed.

Very sincerely,
