1. loop though comments and remove exact duplicates of perviously seen comments
2. if the number of exact duplicates is five or more, that comment becomes a form
3. generate a number of clusters equal to the number of forms plus 1 for unique comments
4. for each cluster generate a query from the associated form
5. for each comment in the sample data, determine which form it is closest to or if it is not similar to any  put it in the "unique" cluster
